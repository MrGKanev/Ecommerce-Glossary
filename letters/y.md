|Year-over-Year (YoY)|`"A comparison metric that measures performance against the same period in the previous year, accounting for seasonality patterns. YoY analysis reveals true growth trends by comparing equivalent periods (this December vs last December). Calculations include YoY growth rate: ((Current - Previous) / Previous) x 100. YoY is essential for seasonal businesses where month-over-month comparisons are misleading. Metrics to track YoY include revenue, traffic, conversion rate, and customer acquisition. YoY analysis informs forecasting and goal-setting. Multi-year YoY trends show long-term trajectory. Comparing YoY alongside MoM provides complete growth picture."`|-|
|Yield Management|`"Dynamic pricing strategy that adjusts prices based on demand, inventory, and timing to maximize revenue, commonly used in travel and increasingly in ecommerce. Yield management uses data on demand patterns, competitor pricing, inventory levels, and customer segments to optimize prices. Applications include surge pricing during high demand, markdowns for aging inventory, and personalized pricing. Airlines and hotels pioneered yield management; ecommerce adoption is growing with AI capabilities. Benefits include margin optimization and inventory efficiency. Transparency and fairness concerns require ethical implementation. Tools like Prisync and Dynamic Yield automate yield management."`|-|
|YouTube Shopping|`"Integration allowing creators and brands to tag and sell products directly within YouTube videos, live streams, and Shorts. Viewers can browse products, view details, and purchase without leaving YouTube. Setup requires Google Merchant Center connection, eligible products, and monetization requirements. YouTube Shopping works through tagged products in content, dedicated shopping tabs, and live shopping features. Creator affiliate programs enable commission-based selling. YouTube's massive audience and video format suits product demonstration and discovery. Success requires engaging content that naturally integrates product showcases rather than overt selling."`|[YouTube Shopping](https://www.youtube.com/shopping)|
|Youth Marketing|`"Strategies targeting Gen Z and younger Millennial consumers, requiring platform-native approaches and authentic brand values. Young consumers heavily use TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube for product discovery. They value authenticity, sustainability, social responsibility, and peer recommendations over traditional advertising. Marketing approaches include influencer partnerships, user-generated content campaigns, and interactive experiences. Mobile-first and visual-first content is essential. Young consumers are price-conscious but willing to pay for aligned values. Building brand loyalty early can yield lifetime customer value as spending power increases with age."`|-|
