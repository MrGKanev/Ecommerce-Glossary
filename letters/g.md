|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Google Analytics|`"Free analytics platform tracking website traffic, user behavior, and conversion data, essential for understanding ecommerce performance. GA tracks visitors, sessions, pageviews, bounce rate, time on site, and conversion goals. Ecommerce tracking reveals revenue, transactions, average order value, and product performance. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) replaced Universal Analytics with event-based tracking, cross-platform measurement, and machine learning insights. Implementation requires proper tagging, enhanced ecommerce setup, and privacy compliance. Analytics data informs marketing, UX, and merchandising decisions."`|[Link](https://analytics.google.com)|
|Google Ads|`"Paid advertising platform for search, display, shopping, and video ads across Google's network, reaching billions of users daily. Ad types include text search ads, product shopping ads, display banners, YouTube video ads, and Performance Max campaigns. Bidding strategies range from manual CPC to automated smart bidding optimized for conversions. Success requires keyword research, compelling ad copy, landing page optimization, and ongoing bid management. ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) is the key profitability metric. Google Ads typically delivers the highest purchase intent among paid channels."`|[Link](https://ads.google.com)|
|Google Search Console|`"Free tool for monitoring website performance in Google search and fixing indexing issues, essential for SEO. Features include search query reports, page indexing status, mobile usability checks, Core Web Vitals data, and sitemap management. Alerts notify of crawling errors, security issues, or manual actions. Search performance reports show queries, impressions, clicks, CTR, and average position. Data helps identify content opportunities and technical SEO problems. Integration with Google Analytics provides complete search visibility. Every ecommerce site should have Search Console configured."`|[Link](https://search.google.com/search-console)|
|Google Shopping|`"Product listing ads appearing in Google search results with images, prices, and store information, driving high-intent traffic. Shopping ads display in a dedicated shopping tab and blended into main search results. Ads are powered by product feed data submitted through Google Merchant Center. Performance depends on feed quality, competitive pricing, product images, and reviews. Smart Shopping and Performance Max campaigns use machine learning for bidding and placement. Shopping ads typically have higher conversion rates than text ads due to visual product presentation and price transparency."`|-|
|Google Merchant Center|`"Platform for uploading product feeds to power Google Shopping, free listings, and other Google commerce services. Feeds include product data like title, description, price, image, availability, and identifiers (GTIN, MPN). Feed quality directly impacts ad eligibility and performance. Requirements include accurate pricing, in-stock status, and policy compliance. Merchant Center shows diagnostics for feed errors and disapprovals. Integration with ecommerce platforms enables automatic feed sync. Free product listings provide organic exposure alongside paid Shopping ads."`|[Link](https://merchants.google.com)|
|Guest Checkout|`"Allowing purchases without account creation, reducing friction and cart abandonment for first-time buyers. Forced registration is a leading cause of checkout abandonment. Guest checkout collects necessary shipping and payment information without password creation. Post-purchase, customers can optionally create accounts with pre-filled data. Benefits include faster checkout and lower abandonment; tradeoffs include less customer data and no order history access. Optimal approach offers both guest and account options, emphasizing guest checkout's simplicity while explaining account benefits."`|-|
|Gift Card|`"Prepaid store credit that can be purchased as gifts or used for customer retention, representing a unique revenue and marketing opportunity. Gift cards create guaranteed future sales, often resulting in purchases exceeding the card value. Digital gift cards offer instant delivery; physical cards work for retail and gifting occasions. Gift card programs require liability tracking, fraud prevention, and expiration compliance (varies by jurisdiction). Integration with POS for omnichannel redemption is important for brick-and-click retailers. Gift cards also serve as refund alternatives and customer appreciation tools."`|-|
|GDPR|`"General Data Protection Regulation - EU privacy law requiring consent for data collection, processing transparency, and data subject rights. GDPR applies to any business serving EU residents, regardless of business location. Requirements include privacy policies, cookie consent, data access/deletion requests, breach notification, and data protection officers for large processors. Fines can reach 4% of global revenue. GDPR drove global privacy awareness, inspiring similar laws (CCPA, LGPD). Compliance involves legal review, technical implementation, and ongoing governance. Privacy-by-design principles help build compliant systems from the start."`|-|
|GA4|`"Google Analytics 4 - the current version of Google Analytics replacing Universal Analytics, featuring event-based tracking and machine learning insights. GA4 uses a different data model where everything is an event rather than sessions and pageviews. Benefits include cross-platform tracking (web and app), privacy-centric design, and predictive metrics. Ecommerce tracking requires specific event implementation (view_item, add_to_cart, purchase). The interface and reports differ significantly from Universal Analytics. Explorations enable custom analysis. BigQuery export allows advanced data analysis. Proper GA4 setup is essential for modern ecommerce analytics."`|-|
|Geo-Targeting|`"Delivering different content, pricing, or experiences based on user geographic location detected via IP address or GPS. Applications include showing local currency, relevant shipping options, language preferences, and location-specific promotions. Geo-targeting can restrict products by region (licensing, regulations) or optimize inventory routing. Privacy considerations require transparency about location data usage. CDNs enable geo-targeted content delivery at the edge. Testing geo-targeted experiences requires VPN or location spoofing tools."`|-|
|Gross Margin|`"Revenue minus cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage, indicating profitability before operating expenses. Calculated as (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue x 100. Ecommerce gross margins vary widely by category: apparel (50-70%), electronics (15-30%), groceries (10-20%). Higher margins enable more aggressive customer acquisition spending. Gross margin analysis by product, category, and channel informs merchandising and pricing decisions. Improving margins involves supplier negotiations, operational efficiency, and strategic pricing. Gross margin return on inventory investment (GMROI) measures inventory productivity."`|-|
