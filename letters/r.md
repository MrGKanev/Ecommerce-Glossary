|Retargeting|`"Advertising strategy that shows ads to users who have previously visited your website, reminding them to return and complete a purchase. Retargeting uses cookies or pixel tracking to identify past visitors across the web and social media. Common retargeting scenarios include cart abandonment (showing items left behind), browse abandonment (viewed but not added), and past purchasers (cross-sell/upsell). Platforms include Google Ads, Meta Ads, and Criteo. Retargeting typically achieves higher conversion rates and ROAS than prospecting campaigns. Frequency capping prevents ad fatigue. Privacy changes are shifting retargeting toward first-party data."`|-|
|Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)|`"A marketing metric measuring revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising, calculated as Revenue / Ad Spend. ROAS of 4x means $4 revenue for each $1 spent. Target ROAS depends on margins - lower margin products need higher ROAS for profitability. ROAS is the primary efficiency metric for paid advertising, used to optimize campaigns and allocate budget. Attribution models affect ROAS calculation (last-click vs. multi-touch). Blended ROAS considers all marketing spend and total revenue. ROAS should be evaluated alongside customer lifetime value for sustainable growth strategies."`|-|
|Return Policy|`"The rules and conditions under which customers can return products for refund or exchange, a key factor in purchase decisions. Liberal return policies reduce purchase risk and increase conversion but may increase return rates. Policy elements include timeframe (30, 60, 90 days), condition requirements (tags attached, unworn), return shipping responsibility, and refund method (original payment, store credit). Clear policy communication reduces disputes. Return policies must balance customer experience with protecting against abuse. For apparel, return rates can reach 30-40%, making policy design critical for profitability."`|-|
|Revenue|`"The total income generated from sales before expenses are deducted, appearing as the top line of financial statements. Gross revenue includes all sales; net revenue subtracts returns, refunds, and discounts. Revenue is a fundamental business metric but doesn't indicate profitability. Revenue growth rate shows business trajectory. Revenue by channel, product, and customer segment reveals performance patterns. Average revenue per user (ARPU) is important for subscription businesses. While chasing revenue growth, businesses must ensure unit economics remain healthy. Revenue recognition timing matters for accounting compliance."`|-|
|Reviews|`"Customer feedback and ratings displayed on product pages that influence purchase decisions and build social proof. Reviews significantly impact conversion rates - products with reviews convert 3-4x better than those without. Review elements include star ratings, written feedback, photos/videos, and verified purchase badges. Review collection strategies include post-purchase emails, incentives (carefully - must comply with platform rules), and in-product prompts. Responding to negative reviews demonstrates customer care. Review aggregation and syndication extends reach. Fake reviews damage trust and violate platform policies."`|-|
|Responsive Design|`"Web design approach that ensures websites adapt and display properly across all device sizes using flexible grids, images, and CSS media queries. Responsive sites automatically adjust layout, navigation, and content for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Mobile-first design prioritizes smaller screens then enhances for larger. Google uses mobile-friendliness as a ranking factor, making responsive design essential for SEO. Key responsive elements include touch-friendly buttons, readable text, and fast loading. Testing across devices and browsers ensures consistent experiences."`|-|
|REST API|`"Representational State Transfer - the standard architectural style for building web APIs that enable different ecommerce systems to communicate. REST APIs use HTTP methods: GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove). APIs return data in JSON format. REST principles include statelessness, resource-based URLs, and standardized responses. Ecommerce REST APIs connect platforms with shipping carriers, payment processors, ERPs, and marketing tools. Well-documented APIs with authentication, rate limiting, and versioning enable reliable integrations. API-first design underpins headless and composable commerce architectures."`|-|
|Recurring Revenue|`"Predictable income from subscription products or services that customers pay for on a regular schedule (monthly, quarterly, annually). Recurring revenue provides financial stability, predictable cash flow, and higher customer lifetime value. Metrics include MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), and churn rate. Subscription models work for consumables (coffee, vitamins), access (streaming, software), and curation (subscription boxes). Building recurring revenue requires excellent retention, low churn, and strong customer relationships. Recurring revenue businesses often command higher valuations than one-time purchase models."`|-|
|Referral Program|`"A marketing strategy that rewards existing customers for referring new customers to your store, leveraging word-of-mouth at scale. Referral program structures include give-get (referrer and friend both receive value), credit/discount rewards, and tiered rewards for multiple referrals. Successful programs make sharing easy through unique links, email, and social sharing. Tracking attributes conversions to referring customers. Referral programs have lower CAC than paid advertising because existing customers are pre-qualified advocates. Program promotion through email, post-purchase, and account pages drives participation."`|-|
|Refund|`"Money returned to a customer after a product return, order cancellation, or service issue. Refund processing time affects customer satisfaction - instant refunds improve experience but increase fraud risk. Refund methods include original payment method, store credit, or exchanges. Partial refunds address issues while retaining some revenue. Tracking refund reasons reveals product or process problems. High refund rates indicate quality, fulfillment, or description accuracy issues. Refund policies should be clear, fair, and consistently applied. Automation speeds processing and reduces customer service workload."`|-|
|Retention Rate|`"The percentage of customers who make repeat purchases over a given period, indicating customer loyalty and experience quality. Calculated as customers at end of period minus new customers, divided by customers at start. High retention reduces customer acquisition needs and increases lifetime value. Retention strategies include loyalty programs, personalized marketing, excellent service, and subscription offerings. Cohort analysis tracks retention patterns over time. Even small retention improvements significantly impact profitability. Retention is typically cheaper than acquisition, making it a priority for mature ecommerce businesses."`|-|
