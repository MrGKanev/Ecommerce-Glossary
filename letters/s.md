|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|SEO (Search Engine Optimization)|`"Strategies and techniques to improve website visibility in organic (unpaid) search results, driving free traffic through better rankings. SEO encompasses on-page optimization (content, keywords, meta tags, internal linking), technical SEO (site speed, mobile-friendliness, structured data, crawlability), and off-page SEO (backlinks, brand mentions). Ecommerce SEO requires optimizing product pages, category pages, and blog content. Search engine algorithms evolve constantly, requiring ongoing adaptation. SEO results compound over time but take months to materialize. Organic search often provides the highest ROI traffic source for established stores."`|-|
|SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)|`"A unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each product variant for inventory tracking, order fulfillment, and reporting. SKU structures typically encode product information: category, brand, size, color (e.g., SHIRT-BLU-M-001). Consistent SKU conventions across all channels prevent confusion. SKUs differ from GTINs/UPCs, which are universal product identifiers. Good SKU practices include avoiding ambiguous characters (0/O, 1/I), limiting length, and maintaining logical structure. SKUs are fundamental to inventory management, warehouse operations, and product analytics. Each unique variant (size, color) should have its own SKU."`|-|
|Shopify|`"The leading SaaS ecommerce platform enabling merchants to create online stores without technical expertise, powering millions of businesses worldwide. Shopify provides hosting, checkout, payments (Shopify Payments), themes, and app ecosystem. Plans range from basic ($29/month) to enterprise (Shopify Plus). Strengths include ease of use, reliability, and ecosystem breadth. Shopify takes transaction fees unless using Shopify Payments. The platform suits most small-to-medium businesses; complex B2B or highly custom needs may require alternatives. Recent innovations include Shop Pay, Hydrogen (headless), and AI features."`|[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com)|
|Shopping Cart|`"The virtual container where customers collect products before checkout, a critical component of the purchase flow. Cart functionality includes adding/removing items, quantity adjustment, variant selection, and coupon application. Persistent carts save items across sessions and devices. Cart page design should show clear totals, enable quick checkout access, and suggest related products. Mini-cart sidebars allow adding without leaving the page. Cart analytics reveal abandonment points. The transition from cart to checkout is a major drop-off point requiring optimization. Express checkout options bypass cart for faster conversion."`|-|
|Social Commerce|`"Selling products directly through social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and Pinterest without leaving the app. Social commerce integrates shopping into social experiences through shoppable posts, live shopping, product tags, and in-app checkout. Platforms like TikTok Shop and Instagram Shopping handle transactions. Benefits include reduced friction, social proof, and meeting customers where they spend time. Catalog integration syncs products with social platforms. Social commerce is growing rapidly, especially among younger demographics. Success requires platform-native content strategies beyond repurposed marketing."`|-|
|Subscription Commerce|`"Business model where customers pay recurring fees for regular product deliveries, access to services, or curated experiences. Subscription types include replenishment (razors, vitamins), curation (subscription boxes), and access (software, content). Benefits include predictable revenue, higher LTV, and reduced acquisition costs. Challenges include churn management, fulfillment complexity, and customer fatigue. Key metrics include MRR, churn rate, and LTV. Subscription features require billing management, skip/pause flexibility, and easy cancellation. The subscription economy has grown dramatically, with consumers expecting subscription options across categories."`|-|
|SSL Certificate|`"Secure Sockets Layer certificate that encrypts data between browsers and servers, indicated by HTTPS and the padlock icon. SSL is mandatory for ecommerce to protect customer data during transactions. Without SSL, browsers display security warnings that devastate trust. SSL certificates validate domain ownership or organization identity. Modern hosting and SaaS platforms include SSL automatically. Let's Encrypt provides free certificates. SSL affects SEO as Google favors HTTPS sites. Beyond the certificate, proper implementation includes redirecting HTTP to HTTPS and updating internal links."`|-|
|Shipping Rate|`"The cost charged to customers for delivering their orders, which can be structured as flat rate, weight-based, price-based, carrier-calculated, or free. Shipping rate strategy balances cost recovery with conversion optimization. Free shipping thresholds encourage larger orders. Rate tables can vary by destination, product, or customer segment. Shipping costs are the #1 cause of cart abandonment when unexpected. Displaying shipping cost early in the journey reduces surprise abandonment. Carrier rate negotiations and zone optimization reduce costs. Offering multiple speed/price options lets customers choose their priority."`|-|
|Split Testing|`"Another term for A/B testing - scientifically comparing two or more versions of a page element to determine which performs better. Split tests randomly show different versions to visitors and measure conversion differences. Common ecommerce tests include headlines, CTAs, product images, layouts, and checkout flows. Statistical significance ensures results aren't random chance. Testing tools include Google Optimize, VWO, and Optimizely. Successful testing requires sufficient traffic, clear hypotheses, and one variable per test. Continuous testing culture drives incremental improvements that compound over time."`|-|
|Stripe|`"A leading payment processing platform for online businesses, known for developer-friendly APIs, comprehensive documentation, and global payment support. Stripe handles credit cards, digital wallets, BNPL, and local payment methods in 46+ countries. Features include fraud prevention (Radar), subscription billing, and financial services (Atlas, Treasury). Pricing is typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for domestic cards. Stripe's clean API and extensive functionality made it the default choice for tech companies and startups. Competitors include PayPal, Square, and Adyen. Stripe continues expanding into commerce tools beyond payments."`|[Stripe](https://stripe.com)|
|Stock|`"The quantity of products available for sale, fundamental to ecommerce operations. Stock management involves tracking quantities, setting safety stock levels, managing reorder points, and handling multi-location inventory. Real-time stock visibility prevents overselling and enables accurate availability display. Stock status affects customer experience - showing sold-out items frustrates shoppers. Stock allocation across channels (website, marketplace, retail) requires strategy. Stock velocity and turnover metrics inform purchasing decisions. Out-of-stock situations lose sales; overstock ties up capital. Inventory accuracy is essential for efficient operations."`|-|
|SaaS (Software as a Service)|`"Cloud-based software delivered via subscription without self-hosting requirements, the dominant model for ecommerce platforms. SaaS examples include Shopify, BigCommerce, and countless ecommerce tools. Benefits include lower upfront costs, automatic updates, managed security, and scalability. Tradeoffs include recurring fees, platform dependency, and customization limits. SaaS pricing typically scales with usage or revenue. Total cost of ownership comparisons with self-hosted alternatives should include hosting, maintenance, and security costs. SaaS enables rapid launch and reduces technical burden, making it ideal for most ecommerce businesses."`|-|
|Segmentation|`"Dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics for targeted marketing and personalized experiences. Segmentation types include demographic (age, location), behavioral (purchase history, browsing), psychographic (values, interests), and RFM (recency, frequency, monetary). Segments enable personalized email campaigns, dynamic website content, and targeted advertising. Effective segmentation balances granularity with actionability. Advanced segmentation uses machine learning for predictive clustering. Segment performance tracking reveals which groups drive the most value. Customer data platforms (CDPs) enable sophisticated real-time segmentation across channels."`|-|
