|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Zero-Party Data|`"Data that customers intentionally and proactively share with brands, including preferences, purchase intentions, and personal context. Unlike first-party data (observed behavior), zero-party data is explicitly provided through surveys, preference centers, quizzes, and account profiles. Zero-party data is increasingly valuable as third-party cookies phase out and privacy regulations tighten. Collection requires value exchange - customers share data expecting better experiences. Use cases include product recommendations, personalized content, and targeted marketing. Examples include style quizzes, skincare assessments, and preference selections. Zero-party data builds deeper customer relationships through declared interests."`|-|
|Zone Pricing|`"Shipping rate strategy where costs are calculated based on geographic zones or distance from fulfillment centers, balancing accuracy with simplicity. Carriers define zones radiating outward from origin; rates increase with zone distance. Zone pricing is more accurate than flat-rate shipping but simpler than exact distance calculation. Multiple fulfillment locations can reduce average zone distances and costs. Zone-based strategies may include free shipping for nearby zones and calculated rates for distant zones. Understanding zone distribution of customers informs fulfillment network decisions. Zone pricing integrates with carrier rate APIs for real-time calculation."`|-|
|Zendesk|`"Popular customer service platform used by ecommerce businesses for support tickets, live chat, help centers, and customer communication. Zendesk provides multichannel support (email, chat, social, phone) in a unified interface. Features include ticket management, macros, automation, reporting, and self-service knowledge bases. Integration with ecommerce platforms enables order lookup and customer context. Zendesk pricing scales with features and agent count. Alternatives include Freshdesk, Intercom, and Gorgias (ecommerce-focused). Customer service quality significantly impacts retention and lifetime value, making support platform investment worthwhile."`|[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com)|
|Zoom|`"Product image magnification feature allowing customers to see fine details when hovering or clicking on product photos. Zoom functionality is essential for products where detail matters: jewelry, electronics, fashion, and crafts. Implementation options include hover zoom, click-to-enlarge, and pinch-to-zoom on mobile. High-resolution source images (2000px+) are required for quality zoom. Zoom can reveal product quality or flaws, so image quality matters. User testing reveals preferred zoom behavior for your audience. Zoom functionality should work seamlessly across devices. Combined with multiple angles, zoom provides the visual information customers need for confident purchasing."`|-|
|Z-Pattern|`"A common eye-tracking pattern where users scan web pages in a Z-shaped motion: left-to-right across the top, diagonally down, and left-to-right across the bottom. Understanding Z-pattern informs layout decisions - placing important elements (logo, navigation, CTAs) along the Z path. The pattern applies primarily to text-light pages; content-heavy pages follow F-pattern. Homepage and landing page design benefits from Z-pattern awareness. Key conversion elements should appear at Z-pattern endpoints. A/B testing validates layout assumptions. While patterns provide guidance, user behavior varies by content and audience."`|-|
