|JavaScript|`"A programming language that enables interactive and dynamic functionality on ecommerce websites, from product carousels to real-time inventory updates. JavaScript powers frontend interactions like add-to-cart buttons, image zooms, form validation, and personalization. Modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Next.js build sophisticated shopping experiences. JavaScript also runs server-side (Node.js) for APIs and backend services. Performance optimization is crucial as excessive JavaScript can slow page loads. Understanding JavaScript basics helps with analytics implementation, tag management, and troubleshooting. Nearly all ecommerce sites depend heavily on JavaScript."`|[MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)|
|Just-in-Time (JIT) Inventory|`"An inventory management strategy where products are ordered and received only as needed for production or sale, minimizing storage costs and capital tied in inventory. JIT reduces warehousing expenses, obsolescence risk, and handling costs. Tradeoffs include vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, need for reliable suppliers, and risk of stockouts during demand spikes. JIT works best for predictable demand, short lead times, and strong supplier relationships. The strategy originated in Japanese manufacturing and adapts to ecommerce through demand-driven replenishment and dropshipping models. Success requires accurate forecasting and responsive suppliers."`|-|
|Journey Mapping|`"The process of visualizing every touchpoint a customer has with your brand, from initial awareness through purchase and post-sale support. Customer journey maps reveal pain points, opportunities, and moments of truth across channels. Maps typically include customer actions, thoughts, emotions, and touchpoints for each stage. Stages often include awareness, consideration, decision, purchase, and loyalty. Journey mapping informs UX improvements, marketing strategy, and customer experience investments. Combining qualitative research with analytics data creates comprehensive maps. Regular updates ensure maps reflect evolving customer behavior."`|-|
|JSON|`"JavaScript Object Notation - a lightweight data format used extensively in ecommerce APIs for exchanging product data, order information, and customer details between systems. JSON's human-readable structure makes it easy to understand and debug. JSON is the standard format for REST APIs, webhooks, and data feeds. Product catalogs, order payloads, and analytics events commonly use JSON. Compared to XML, JSON is more compact and easier to parse. Understanding JSON structure helps with API integrations, feed troubleshooting, and data analysis. Tools like Postman and jq help work with JSON data."`|-|
|JSON-LD|`"A structured data format embedded in HTML that helps search engines understand product information, reviews, pricing, and availability for rich snippets in search results. JSON-LD (Linked Data) is Google's preferred structured data format. Product schema markup can display star ratings, prices, and availability directly in search results, improving click-through rates. Proper implementation follows Schema.org vocabulary. Validation tools like Google's Rich Results Test ensure correct markup. E-commerce platforms often include JSON-LD automatically; custom sites require manual implementation. Structured data is essential for modern ecommerce SEO."`|[Schema.org](https://schema.org)|
|Junk Fee|`"Hidden or unexpected charges added during checkout that weren't clearly disclosed upfront, leading to cart abandonment and customer distrust. Examples include service fees, handling charges, and unexplained surcharges. Regulatory scrutiny of junk fees is increasing, with some jurisdictions requiring all-inclusive pricing. Transparent pricing builds trust and reduces abandonment. If fees are necessary, disclosing them early in the shopping experience maintains customer confidence. Competitor analysis of total pricing helps set competitive all-in prices."`|-|
