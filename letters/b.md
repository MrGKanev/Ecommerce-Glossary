|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Blog|`"Content marketing hub for ecommerce, driving organic traffic and building brand authority through valuable articles. Effective ecommerce blogs cover product guides, how-to content, industry news, and lifestyle topics that resonate with target audiences. Blog content supports SEO by targeting long-tail keywords and building internal links to product pages. Successful blogs publish consistently, optimize for search, include clear CTAs, and promote content through email and social media. Metrics to track include organic traffic, time on page, and conversion from blog visitors."`|-|
|B2B (Business to Business)|`"Commerce between businesses, including wholesale, manufacturing suppliers, SaaS services, and professional equipment. B2B ecommerce differs from B2C with longer sales cycles, larger order values, complex pricing (volume discounts, negotiated rates), purchase approvals, and relationship-based selling. Key features for B2B stores include quote requests, purchase orders, credit terms, customer-specific catalogs, and reordering workflows. B2B ecommerce has grown rapidly as buyers expect consumer-like digital experiences."`|-|
|B2C (Business to Consumer)|`"Direct sales from businesses to end consumers, the most common ecommerce model. B2C transactions are typically lower value, higher volume, and driven by emotional factors and convenience. Success requires great product photography, compelling descriptions, fast checkout, excellent customer service, and effective marketing. B2C ecommerce is highly competitive, making brand differentiation, customer experience, and retention strategies critical for sustainable growth."`|-|
|BigCommerce|`"A SaaS ecommerce platform for mid-market and enterprise businesses with strong B2B features, headless capabilities, and multi-channel selling. BigCommerce offers extensive built-in features with less reliance on apps compared to Shopify. Notable for no transaction fees on any payment gateway and robust API capabilities. The platform serves diverse industries including fashion, electronics, automotive parts, and food/beverage. Enterprise plans offer dedicated support, unlimited API calls, and priority routing."`|[Link](https://www.bigcommerce.com)|
|Billing Address|`"The address associated with a customer's payment method, used for fraud verification through Address Verification Service (AVS). The billing address must match records on file with the card issuer. It differs from the shipping address, which is where products are delivered. Mismatches between billing and shipping addresses can flag orders for fraud review, though legitimate reasons exist (gifts, work deliveries). Collecting accurate billing addresses is essential for payment authorization and chargeback disputes."`|-|
|Bounce Rate|`"Percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page, indicating potential content or UX issues. High bounce rates on landing pages suggest misalignment between traffic source expectations and page content. For product pages, high bounces may indicate poor product presentation, pricing, or lack of trust signals. Normal bounce rates vary by page type: blog posts (70-90%), category pages (40-60%), product pages (30-50%). Reducing bounce rate involves improving page speed, relevance, design, and mobile experience."`|-|
|Brick-and-Click|`"Businesses operating both physical stores and online ecommerce, offering omnichannel experiences. This hybrid model combines the immediacy and tactile experience of physical retail with the convenience and reach of online shopping. Key omnichannel capabilities include buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS), ship-from-store, endless aisle (ordering online from store), and unified inventory visibility. Successful brick-and-click retailers maintain consistent pricing, branding, and customer experience across all channels."`|-|
|Bundling|`"Selling multiple products together as a package, often at a discount to increase average order value and move inventory. Bundle types include pure bundles (only available together), mixed bundles (available separately or together), and cross-category bundles (complementary products). Bundling simplifies purchasing decisions, introduces customers to new products, and creates unique value propositions. Effective bundle pricing shows perceived savings while maintaining margins. Dynamic bundling uses AI to recommend personalized combinations."`|-|
|Buy-to-Detail Rate|`"Conversion metric measuring purchases per product detail page view, indicating product page effectiveness. Calculated as orders divided by product page views. A low rate suggests issues with product presentation, pricing, reviews, or lack of trust. Benchmark varies by industry but typically ranges from 2-5%. Improving buy-to-detail rate involves optimizing product photography, descriptions, social proof, scarcity messaging, and reducing friction to add-to-cart. Tracking this metric by product category identifies optimization opportunities."`|-|
|Buyer Persona|`"Semi-fictional representation of ideal customers based on research and data, guiding marketing strategy and product decisions. Personas include demographic information, goals, challenges, buying behavior, and preferred channels. For ecommerce, personas inform product selection, messaging, content creation, advertising targeting, and UX design. Effective personas are based on customer interviews, survey data, analytics, and sales team insights rather than assumptions. Regularly updating personas ensures they remain accurate as customer bases evolve."`|-|
|BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later)|`"Payment option allowing customers to split purchases into installments, offered by services like Klarna, Afterpay, Affirm, and Shop Pay Installments. BNPL increases conversion rates (especially for higher-priced items) and average order value by making purchases more affordable. Merchants receive full payment upfront (minus fees of 2-6%) while the BNPL provider handles installment collection and risk. Popular among younger shoppers, BNPL now accounts for 5-10% of ecommerce payment volume in mature markets."`|-|
|Breadcrumbs|`"Navigation elements showing the path from homepage to current page, improving UX and SEO. Breadcrumbs help users understand site structure, navigate between levels, and reduce bounce rates. For SEO, breadcrumbs provide internal linking and can appear in search results through structured data markup. Typical format: Home > Category > Subcategory > Product. Best practices include making each level clickable, using clear labels, and ensuring mobile-friendly design with adequate tap targets."`|-|
|Backorder|`"An order placed for a product temporarily out of stock, with fulfillment delayed until inventory is replenished. Backorders allow merchants to capture sales rather than losing customers to competitors. Clear communication about expected delivery dates is essential for customer satisfaction. Managing backorders requires accurate supplier lead times, proactive customer updates, and options to cancel if delays extend. Some platforms allow customers to choose between waiting or being notified when in stock."`|-|
|Brand Awareness|`"The extent to which consumers recognize and remember a brand. In ecommerce, strong brand awareness drives direct traffic, higher conversion rates, and ability to command premium pricing. Building awareness involves consistent visual identity, memorable messaging, content marketing, social media presence, influencer partnerships, and paid advertising. Measuring brand awareness includes tracking branded search volume, direct traffic, social mentions, and survey data. Brand awareness compounds over time, reducing customer acquisition costs."`|-|
|Business Intelligence (BI)|`"Tools and practices for collecting, integrating, and analyzing business data to support decision-making. Ecommerce BI encompasses sales analytics, customer analytics, inventory analysis, marketing attribution, and financial reporting. Modern BI platforms like Looker, Tableau, and Power BI visualize data from multiple sources. Effective BI requires clean data integration, well-defined KPIs, accessible dashboards, and a data-driven culture. AI-powered BI is emerging with natural language queries and automated insights."`|-|
