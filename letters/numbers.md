|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)|`"Security requiring two verification methods to access accounts, protecting against unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Common 2FA methods include SMS codes (less secure), authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy), and hardware security keys (YubiKey). Ecommerce applications include admin panel access, customer account protection, and high-value transaction verification. 2FA significantly reduces account takeover fraud. Best practice requires 2FA for all admin access. Customer-facing 2FA should balance security with friction. 2FA is part of broader security strategy including strong passwords, monitoring, and regular audits."`|-|
|3PL (Third-Party Logistics)|`"Outsourced fulfillment services handling warehousing, picking, packing, and shipping for ecommerce businesses. 3PL providers offer expertise, infrastructure, technology, and scale that would be expensive to replicate in-house. Services range from basic storage and shipping to value-added services like kitting, custom packaging, and returns processing. Major 3PLs include ShipBob, Deliverr (now part of Shopify), and Red Stag Fulfillment. 3PL selection criteria include location network, technology integration, pricing, specialization, and scalability. 3PLs enable focus on core business while outsourcing complex logistics operations."`|-|
|301 Redirect|`"Permanent URL redirect telling browsers and search engines that a page has moved permanently to a new location. 301 redirects pass approximately 90-99% of link equity (SEO value) to the new URL. Use cases include site migration, URL restructuring, and consolidating duplicate content. Implementation through server configuration, .htaccess, or platform settings. Redirect chains (A->B->C) dilute SEO value; direct redirects are preferred. Maintaining redirect maps prevents broken links. 301s should be implemented before old URLs are removed. Monitoring for 404 errors reveals missing redirects. Proper 301 management is essential for SEO during site changes."`|-|
|302 Redirect|`"Temporary URL redirect indicating pages will return to their original location, preserving SEO value at the original URL. 302 redirects are appropriate for A/B tests, temporary pages, and maintenance redirects. Unlike 301s, 302s signal to search engines that the original URL should remain indexed. Misusing 302 for permanent moves can hurt SEO by splitting link equity. Most URL changes in ecommerce should use 301 (permanent) rather than 302 (temporary). Server logs and analytics help verify redirect behavior. Incorrect redirect types are a common SEO technical issue."`|-|
|404 Error|`"Page not found error displayed when a requested URL doesn't exist or has been removed. 404 errors hurt user experience, waste crawl budget, and indicate broken internal links or missing redirects. Custom 404 pages should include navigation, search, and helpful suggestions rather than dead ends. Monitoring 404s through analytics and Search Console reveals issues requiring redirects or fixes. Causes include deleted products, changed URLs, broken links, and typos. High 404 rates from internal links indicate site structure problems. External 404s may warrant redirects to relevant content. 404 management is ongoing maintenance."`|-|
|500 Error|`"Internal server error indicating something went wrong on the server side, preventing the page from loading. 500 errors are critical issues affecting all users hitting the affected functionality. Causes include code bugs, server overload, database issues, and hosting problems. Immediate investigation is required as 500 errors directly cause lost sales. Error logging and monitoring tools (Sentry, Datadog) help identify root causes. Custom 500 pages should apologize and suggest actions while alerting technical teams. Load testing helps prevent traffic-induced 500 errors. Server health monitoring catches issues before they affect customers."`|-|
|24/7 Support|`"Customer service availability around the clock, every day of the week, meeting customer expectations for immediate assistance. Options for 24/7 coverage include global support teams across time zones, outsourced after-hours support, AI chatbots handling common queries, and self-service knowledge bases. 24/7 support is increasingly expected, especially for global customers and urgent issues (payment problems, order changes). Cost-effective approaches combine chatbots for tier-1 queries with human escalation. Ticket systems enable async communication when live support isn't available. Evaluating contact volume patterns informs staffing and automation decisions."`|-|
|360-Degree Product View|`"Interactive product visualization allowing customers to rotate and examine products from all angles, providing comprehensive understanding before purchase. 360 views are created from multiple photos stitched together or 3D renders. Effective for products where shape and dimension matter: furniture, electronics, jewelry, and fashion. 360 views reduce return rates and increase conversion by building purchase confidence. Implementation options include photography rigs, software solutions, and 3D modeling. File size optimization ensures fast loading. Mobile support requires touch interaction. 360 views complement but don't replace traditional product photography."`|-|
