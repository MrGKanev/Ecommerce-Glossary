|Hashtag|`"Keywords prefixed with # used on social media to categorize and discover content, essential for social commerce visibility. Strategic hashtag use increases post reach and attracts new followers. Best practices include mixing popular, niche, and branded hashtags. Hashtag research tools identify trending and relevant tags. Platform differences matter: Instagram allows up to 30, Twitter recommends 1-2, TikTok favors trending sounds alongside hashtags. Branded hashtags enable user-generated content campaigns. Monitoring hashtags provides customer insights and engagement opportunities."`|-|
|HTML|`"Hypertext Markup Language - the standard code for structuring web pages, fundamental to ecommerce website development. HTML elements define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. Semantic HTML improves accessibility and SEO. HTML5 introduced modern features like video, audio, and geolocation. While ecommerce platforms abstract HTML, understanding basics helps with customization, email templates, and troubleshooting. Proper HTML structure supports screen readers and search engine crawlers. Clean, valid HTML improves page rendering speed and consistency across browsers."`|[Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)|
|Headless Commerce|`"Architecture separating the frontend presentation from backend commerce functionality via APIs, enabling flexible, customized experiences. The 'head' (frontend) is decoupled from commerce engine, allowing different technologies for each. Benefits include frontend freedom, faster iteration, and omnichannel delivery (web, mobile app, kiosk, IoT). Headless platforms include commercetools, Medusa, and Shopify Hydrogen. Tradeoffs include higher development complexity and cost. Headless suits brands needing custom experiences beyond template limitations. API-first design is the foundation of headless architecture."`|-|
|Hero Image|`"The large, prominent image at the top of a webpage, typically showcasing featured products, promotions, or brand messaging. Hero sections are prime real estate influencing first impressions. Effective heroes have clear focal points, minimal text, strong CTAs, and fast loading. Mobile optimization is crucial - heroes often need different layouts for small screens. Auto-rotating carousels are common but often ignored by users; static heroes or minimal slides perform better. A/B testing hero content reveals what drives engagement and conversion."`|-|
|Heatmap|`"Visual representation of where users click, scroll, move their mouse, and spend time on your pages, revealing UX insights. Click heatmaps show popular and ignored areas. Scroll heatmaps reveal how far users read. Move maps suggest eye tracking patterns. Heatmap tools like Hotjar, Crazy Egg, and FullStory aggregate data into color-coded visualizations. Insights inform CTA placement, content prioritization, and navigation design. Combined with session recordings, heatmaps provide qualitative understanding beyond analytics numbers. Regular heatmap analysis should inform ongoing optimization."`|-|
|HTTP Status Codes|`"Server responses indicating request outcomes: success (200), redirects (301/302), client errors (404), or server errors (500). For ecommerce, proper status codes affect SEO and user experience. 404 pages need helpful content and search functionality. 301 redirects preserve SEO when URLs change. 503 during maintenance signals temporary unavailability. Monitoring for 5xx errors prevents lost sales from server issues. Proper status codes help search engines understand site structure. Custom error pages improve experience when things go wrong."`|-|
|Hosting|`"Server infrastructure where website files are stored and served to visitors, fundamental to ecommerce performance. Hosting types include shared, VPS, dedicated, and cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). Managed ecommerce hosting handles security and updates. Key factors include uptime, speed, scalability, security, and support. SaaS platforms like Shopify include hosting; self-hosted solutions require separate hosting. Geographic server location affects page load times. Auto-scaling handles traffic spikes. Hosting choice significantly impacts site speed, reliability, and security."`|-|
|Holiday Sales|`"Peak shopping periods around major holidays like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, and regional celebrations. Holiday seasons can generate 30-40% of annual revenue for retailers. Preparation includes inventory planning, site performance testing, marketing campaigns, and customer service scaling. Key strategies involve early promotions, email/SMS sequences, retargeting campaigns, and extended return policies. Site infrastructure must handle 10x+ normal traffic. Post-holiday planning addresses returns, gift card redemptions, and new customer retention."`|-|
|Hold Rate|`"The percentage of website visitors who add items to cart, indicating initial purchase intent before checkout completion. Calculated as sessions with add-to-cart divided by total sessions. Hold rate benchmarks range from 5-15% depending on industry and traffic quality. Low hold rates suggest product page optimization opportunities. Combined with cart abandonment rate, hold rate helps diagnose the conversion funnel. Improving hold rate involves compelling product presentation, clear CTAs, trust signals, and relevant recommendations."`|-|
|Homepage|`"The main landing page of an ecommerce website, serving as the digital storefront and primary entry point for direct traffic. Effective homepages balance brand storytelling, product discovery, promotions, and navigation. Key elements include hero section, featured products, category navigation, trust signals, and search. Mobile homepage design prioritizes vertical scrolling and thumb-friendly navigation. Homepage bounce rate indicates first impression effectiveness. Personalized homepages show relevant products based on browsing history. Regular homepage refreshes maintain customer interest and reflect current inventory and campaigns."`|-|
