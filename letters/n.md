|Net Promoter Score (NPS)|`"A customer loyalty metric measuring how likely customers are to recommend your brand to others, scored from -100 to +100. NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (0-6 rating) from promoters (9-10 rating). Passive responses (7-8) are excluded. Scores above 50 are excellent; above 70 are world-class. NPS surveys are typically sent post-purchase or periodically. Follow-up questions reveal reasons behind scores. Tracking NPS over time indicates customer experience trends. NPS correlates with growth, making it a valuable strategic metric alongside transactional satisfaction measures."`|-|
|Niche Market|`"A specialized segment of the market with specific needs, preferences, or identity, often less competitive and more profitable for focused ecommerce stores. Examples include sustainable pet products, left-handed tools, or vintage camera equipment. Niche advantages include passionate audiences, less price sensitivity, higher loyalty, and reduced competition. Niche disadvantages include smaller market size and limited growth ceiling. Successful niche stores become authorities through expertise, community building, and tailored products. Finding the right niche requires balancing passion, market size, competition, and profit potential."`|-|
|Native Checkout|`"A checkout experience that happens directly within a social platform (Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest) without redirecting to an external website. Native checkout reduces friction by keeping users in familiar environments. Platforms handle payment processing and often provide buyer protection. Benefits include higher conversion from social traffic; tradeoffs include limited customization, platform fees, and less customer data. Native checkout is expanding as social commerce grows. Integration requires platform approval and catalog connection. Performance tracking may be limited compared to owned checkout experiences."`|-|
|Next-Day Delivery|`"Shipping option that guarantees delivery by the next business day, now expected as standard by many online shoppers influenced by Amazon Prime. Next-day delivery requires strategic warehouse placement, carrier partnerships, and cut-off times typically in early afternoon. Premium pricing or free shipping thresholds can offset costs. Not all products or locations can support next-day economically. Customer communication about expected delivery creates satisfaction even when next-day isn't possible. Same-day delivery is emerging in urban markets. Delivery speed is increasingly a competitive differentiator."`|-|
|No-Code Platform|`"Tools that allow building ecommerce stores, automations, and applications without any programming knowledge through visual drag-and-drop interfaces. No-code platforms like Shopify, Squarespace, and Wix enable non-technical founders to launch stores quickly. Automation tools like Zapier and Make connect apps without coding. Benefits include speed to market, lower costs, and accessibility. Limitations include customization constraints, performance considerations, and potential platform lock-in. No-code suits many small-to-medium businesses; complex requirements may eventually need custom development."`|-|
|Notification|`"Automated messages sent to customers via email, SMS, push, or in-app channels about order status, promotions, abandoned carts, or back-in-stock alerts. Transactional notifications (order confirmation, shipping updates) have high engagement and build trust. Marketing notifications drive revenue but require permission and frequency management. Notification strategies balance engagement with avoiding fatigue. Personalization improves relevance. Timing optimization increases opens and clicks. Multi-channel notification sequences ensure messages reach customers. Clear unsubscribe options maintain compliance and list health."`|-|
|NFT Commerce|`"The sale of Non-Fungible Tokens representing digital goods, collectibles, membership access, or proof of authenticity through ecommerce platforms. NFTs use blockchain technology to prove ownership and scarcity of digital items. Applications include digital art, virtual fashion, event tickets, exclusive content access, and physical product authentication. The NFT market experienced significant volatility after initial hype. Mainstream adoption depends on simplified user experiences beyond crypto-native audiences. Some brands use NFTs for loyalty programs and community building rather than speculation."`|-|
|Net Revenue|`"Total sales revenue minus returns, refunds, discounts, and allowances, representing actual money retained from sales. Net revenue differs from gross revenue (total sales before deductions) and is more accurate for financial analysis. High return rates significantly impact net revenue versus gross. Net revenue per customer indicates true customer value. Tracking net revenue by product, channel, and segment reveals profitability insights. Improving net revenue involves both increasing sales and reducing returns through better product representation and quality."`|-|
