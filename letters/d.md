|Domain Name|`"The web address of your online store (e.g., www.mystore.com) that customers type to visit your site. A good domain is memorable, brandable, easy to spell, and ideally includes relevant keywords. Domain registration through registrars like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains typically costs $10-50/year. Premium domains can cost thousands or millions. HTTPS (SSL) is essential for security and SEO. Subdomains can separate different functions (shop.example.com, blog.example.com)."`|-|
|Discount Code|`"Alphanumeric codes customers enter at checkout to receive discounts or special offers. Also called promo codes, coupon codes, or voucher codes. Types include percentage off, fixed amount off, free shipping, and buy-one-get-one. Codes can be limited by usage count, date range, minimum order, specific products, or customer segments. Tracking codes by source measures marketing effectiveness. Over-reliance on discounting can train customers to wait for sales and erode margins."`|-|
|Discount Rate|`"The percentage fee charged by payment processors for each transaction, typically 2-4% depending on card type, business risk, and volume. Discount rates consist of interchange fees (paid to issuing banks), assessment fees (paid to card networks), and processor markup. Qualification tiers affect rates based on card presence, verification, and settlement timing. High-volume merchants can negotiate better rates. Alternative payment methods like ACH or crypto have different fee structures."`|-|
|Dropshipping|`"Fulfillment model where products ship directly from supplier to customer without the merchant holding inventory. Dropshippers focus on marketing and customer service while suppliers handle production and fulfillment. Benefits include low startup costs, wide product selection, and location flexibility. Challenges include thin margins (15-30%), shipping delays, quality control, and supplier reliability. Success requires finding reliable suppliers, building a brand beyond products, and efficient marketing. AliExpress and Oberlo popularized consumer dropshipping."`|-|
|D2C (Direct-to-Consumer)|`"Brands selling directly to consumers without retail intermediaries, controlling the entire customer experience. D2C brands build direct relationships, own customer data, capture full margins, and iterate quickly based on feedback. Notable D2C brands include Warby Parker, Casper, Allbirds, and Glossier. Challenges include higher customer acquisition costs without retail foot traffic and competition from established brands adopting D2C. Many D2C brands eventually add wholesale or retail channels for growth."`|-|
|Dynamic Pricing|`"Automatically adjusting prices based on demand, competition, inventory, time, or customer segments. Airlines and hotels pioneered dynamic pricing; ecommerce adoption is growing with AI capabilities. Strategies include competitor-based pricing, demand-based pricing, time-based pricing (flash sales), and personalized pricing. Benefits include margin optimization and inventory management. Risks include customer perception of unfairness and complexity. Tools like Prisync, Competera, and Intelligence Node automate competitive pricing."`|-|
|Digital Wallet|`"Payment methods like Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, or Shop Pay that store payment information for quick, secure checkout. Digital wallets reduce checkout friction and cart abandonment by eliminating manual card entry. They use tokenization for security, replacing card numbers with encrypted tokens. Adoption is growing, especially on mobile devices. Merchants typically pay similar fees to card payments. Supporting popular digital wallets is increasingly table stakes for ecommerce checkout."`|-|
|Dark Mode|`"Alternative color scheme for websites and apps that uses light text on dark backgrounds, reducing eye strain in low-light conditions and saving battery on OLED screens. Offering dark mode demonstrates attention to user experience and accessibility. Implementation requires careful design of all UI elements for both modes. CSS prefers-color-scheme media query can detect system preferences. Dark mode is especially popular among younger users and in tech-oriented product categories."`|-|
|Data Privacy|`"Compliance with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and other laws regarding customer data collection, storage, and usage. Requirements include obtaining consent for data collection, providing transparency about data usage, enabling data access and deletion requests, and implementing proper security measures. Non-compliance can result in significant fines (up to 4% of global revenue under GDPR). Privacy-first approaches are becoming competitive advantages as consumers grow more conscious of data practices. Privacy policies, cookie consent, and opt-in mechanisms are essential."`|-|
|Delivery Management|`"Systems and processes for managing the logistics of getting products from warehouse to customer doorstep. Includes carrier selection, shipping label generation, package tracking, delivery notifications, and exception handling. Modern delivery management platforms integrate multiple carriers, optimize shipping costs, and provide branded tracking experiences. Features like estimated delivery dates, delivery preferences, and real-time updates improve customer satisfaction. Efficient delivery management reduces costs and support inquiries."`|-|
|Digital Products|`"Intangible goods delivered electronically, including software, ebooks, online courses, music, templates, and digital art. Digital products have near-zero marginal costs and infinite scalability. Delivery is instant through download links or streaming. Challenges include piracy protection (DRM), customer support, and licensing management. Platforms like Gumroad, Teachable, and Shopify support digital product sales. Digital goods may have different tax treatment depending on jurisdiction."`|-|
|Demand Forecasting|`"Predicting future product demand to optimize inventory, staffing, and marketing investments. Forecasting methods include historical analysis, trend modeling, seasonal adjustments, and machine learning. Accurate forecasts prevent stockouts (lost sales) and overstock (tied capital, markdowns). Inputs include historical sales, market trends, promotions, seasonality, and external factors. Collaborative forecasting incorporates insights from sales, marketing, and supply chain. Advanced systems provide probabilistic forecasts with confidence intervals."`|-|
|Drop Date|`"A scheduled product release date, often used for limited-edition items, sneakers, or hyped collaborations to build anticipation. Drop culture creates urgency through scarcity and time limits. Successful drops require marketing buildup, waitlists, and robust infrastructure to handle traffic spikes. Queue management systems prevent site crashes. Drop strategies include random draws (raffles), first-come-first-served, and invitation-only access. Post-drop engagement retains customers acquired through the excitement."`|-|
|Dead Stock|`"Inventory that hasn't sold within a reasonable timeframe, tying up capital and storage space. Dead stock often results from overbuying, poor forecasting, trend changes, or product quality issues. Strategies to reduce dead stock include markdowns, bundling, liquidation channels, donation, or recycling. Prevention involves demand forecasting, agile inventory management, and testing demand with smaller initial orders. Dead stock carrying costs include storage, insurance, and opportunity cost of capital."`|-|
