|eBay|`"Global online marketplace for auctions and fixed-price sales, serving as a major third-party selling channel for millions of sellers worldwide. eBay supports various selling formats including traditional auctions, Buy It Now fixed pricing, and Best Offer negotiations. Sellers can use eBay's managed payments or PayPal for transactions. The platform offers seller tools, promoted listings, and store subscriptions. Success on eBay requires competitive pricing, fast shipping, excellent customer service, and positive feedback ratings."`|[Link](https://www.ebay.com)|
|Ecommerce|`"Buying and selling goods and services online through websites, apps, and marketplaces. Ecommerce encompasses various models: B2C (business to consumer), B2B (business to business), C2C (consumer to consumer), and D2C (direct to consumer). Global ecommerce sales exceed $5 trillion annually, driven by mobile shopping, social commerce, and changing consumer habits. Key components include product catalog management, shopping cart, payment processing, order fulfillment, and customer service. Successful ecommerce requires excellence in marketing, user experience, and operations."`|-|
|Email Marketing|`"Promotional and transactional emails to customers, including newsletters, abandoned cart reminders, welcome sequences, and order updates. Email generates the highest ROI of any marketing channel (approximately $40 per $1 spent). Effective email marketing involves building quality lists, segmenting audiences, personalizing content, testing subject lines, and optimizing send timing. Key metrics include open rate, click rate, conversion rate, and unsubscribe rate. Compliance with CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and other regulations is essential."`|-|
|Engagement Rate|`"Metric measuring how actively users interact with content through likes, comments, shares, clicks, and saves. Calculated as total engagements divided by impressions or followers. High engagement indicates content resonance and builds algorithm favor on social platforms. Engagement rate varies by platform: Instagram (1-5%), Facebook (0.5-1%), TikTok (3-9%). Improving engagement involves creating valuable content, posting consistently, responding to comments, and understanding audience preferences. Engagement quality matters as much as quantity for driving conversions."`|-|
|Evergreen Content|`"Timeless content that remains relevant and drives traffic long after publication, unlike news or trend-based content. Examples include how-to guides, FAQs, product care instructions, and educational articles. Evergreen content provides compounding SEO value, consistently attracting organic traffic. It requires periodic updates to maintain accuracy. Successful evergreen content addresses common questions, targets stable search terms, and provides comprehensive value. Building an evergreen content library is essential for sustainable organic growth."`|-|
|Event-Triggered Email|`"Automated emails sent based on customer actions like sign-ups, purchases, cart abandonment, browsing behavior, or milestone events. Also called behavioral emails or triggered campaigns. Event-triggered emails achieve 8x higher open rates than batch campaigns because they're timely and relevant. Common triggers include welcome series, post-purchase follow-up, win-back sequences, and birthday offers. Effective triggered emails require proper event tracking, segmentation logic, and personalized content. Email service providers and marketing automation platforms enable sophisticated trigger-based workflows."`|-|
|Express Checkout|`"Streamlined payment process using saved payment methods for faster transactions, reducing checkout friction and cart abandonment. Express checkout options include Shop Pay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal One Touch, and Amazon Pay. These services securely store payment and shipping information, enabling one-click or biometric-authenticated purchases. Express checkout buttons often appear on product pages, cart, and checkout. Implementing express checkout can increase conversion rates by 20-50%, especially on mobile devices where typing is difficult."`|-|
|Exit Intent Popup|`"Overlay triggered when users are about to leave by detecting mouse movement toward the browser close button or address bar. Exit popups offer last-chance incentives like discounts, free shipping, or email capture. Effective exit popups are visually appealing, offer genuine value, and include easy dismissal. They should appear once per session and respect user experience. Best practices include A/B testing offers, using countdown timers for urgency, and mobile-optimized alternatives since exit intent detection differs on touch devices."`|-|
|Edge Computing|`"Processing data closer to users through distributed server networks for faster page loads and better performance globally. Edge computing reduces latency by serving content from nearby locations rather than distant origin servers. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) like Cloudflare, Fastly, and Akamai provide edge infrastructure. Use cases include image optimization, caching, personalization, and A/B testing at the edge. Edge functions enable server-side logic without origin server round-trips, improving both performance and user experience for global customers."`|-|
|ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)|`"Integrated software systems managing core business processes including inventory, orders, financials, procurement, and supply chain. Popular ERPs include SAP, Oracle NetSuite, and Microsoft Dynamics. ERP integration with ecommerce platforms ensures real-time inventory accuracy, automated order processing, and unified reporting. Implementation requires careful planning, data migration, and change management. Modern cloud ERPs offer better ecommerce integrations than legacy on-premise systems. ERP is essential for scaling ecommerce operations beyond manual processes."`|-|
|Email List|`"A collection of subscriber email addresses who have opted in to receive marketing communications. List quality matters more than size - engaged subscribers drive results while inactive ones hurt deliverability. Building lists involves lead magnets, exit popups, checkout opt-ins, and content upgrades. List hygiene requires regular cleaning of bounced and unengaged addresses. Segmentation enables targeted messaging. Purchased or scraped lists violate regulations and damage sender reputation. Owned email lists are valuable business assets independent of platform algorithms."`|-|
|Ecommerce Platform|`"Software solution providing the infrastructure to build and run an online store, handling product catalog, cart, checkout, payments, and orders. Platform types include SaaS (Shopify, BigCommerce), open-source (WooCommerce, Magento), and headless (commercetools, Medusa). Selection criteria include features, scalability, cost, customization needs, and technical resources. Platform choice significantly impacts operations, marketing capabilities, and growth potential. Migration between platforms is costly, so careful evaluation upfront is important."`|-|
