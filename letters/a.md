|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Abandonment|`"When a visitor leaves your online store without completing the purchase. Cart abandonment rate is a critical KPI in ecommerce, with average rates around 70%. Common causes include unexpected shipping costs, complicated checkout processes, required account creation, and security concerns. Strategies to reduce abandonment include exit-intent popups, abandoned cart emails, transparent pricing, and guest checkout options. Tracking abandonment helps identify friction points in the customer journey."`|-|
|A/B Testing|`"A method comparing two versions of a webpage or element to determine which performs better for conversions. Also known as split testing, it involves showing version A to 50% of visitors and version B to the other 50%, then measuring which drives more purchases, signups, or other goals. Common elements to test include headlines, CTA buttons, product images, pricing displays, and checkout layouts. Statistical significance is crucial for valid results, typically requiring hundreds or thousands of visitors per variation."`|-|
|Affiliate|`"An individual or business promoting products for commission through unique tracking links. Affiliate marketing is a performance-based model where affiliates earn typically 5-30% commission on sales they generate. Affiliates can be bloggers, influencers, comparison sites, or coupon platforms. Merchants benefit from paying only for actual sales, while affiliates earn passive income. Key metrics include click-through rate, conversion rate, earnings per click, and average order value. Popular affiliate networks include ShareASale, CJ Affiliate, and Amazon Associates."`|-|
|Amazon Marketplace|`"The largest third-party ecommerce platform where sellers can reach millions of buyers globally. Sellers can choose between Fulfilled by Merchant (FBM) or Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) options. FBA handles storage, shipping, returns, and customer service for a fee. Amazon charges referral fees (typically 8-15%), FBA fees, and storage fees. Success requires optimizing product listings, managing reviews, competitive pricing, and understanding Amazon's A9 search algorithm. Amazon Brand Registry protects trademarks and unlocks enhanced content features."`|[Link](https://sell.amazon.com)|
|Admin Panel|`"A dashboard where store administrators manage products, orders, customers, and settings. Also called the backend or control panel, it provides centralized access to inventory management, order processing, customer data, analytics, content editing, and store configuration. Modern admin panels offer role-based permissions, bulk editing capabilities, API access, and mobile apps for on-the-go management. Good UX in the admin panel directly impacts operational efficiency and reduces errors."`|-|
|Address Verification Service (AVS)|`"A fraud prevention system that verifies billing addresses match credit card records on file with the card issuer. When a customer enters their billing address, AVS compares the street number and ZIP code against the card issuer's database, returning match codes. Full matches suggest legitimate transactions, while mismatches flag potential fraud. AVS is one layer in a multi-layered fraud prevention strategy alongside CVV verification, 3D Secure, and machine learning fraud detection."`|-|
|Average Order Value (AOV)|`"The average amount spent per transaction, calculated by dividing total revenue by number of orders. AOV is a crucial profitability metric because increasing it costs less than acquiring new customers. Strategies to increase AOV include upselling, cross-selling, bundling, volume discounts, free shipping thresholds, and loyalty rewards. For example, a $50 free shipping threshold encourages customers with $40 carts to add more items. Tracking AOV by channel, device, and customer segment reveals optimization opportunities."`|-|
|API (Application Programming Interface)|`"A set of protocols enabling different software systems to communicate and exchange data programmatically. In ecommerce, APIs connect storefronts with payment processors, shipping carriers, inventory systems, marketing tools, and ERPs. REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations. GraphQL is an alternative offering more flexible queries. Webhooks are event-triggered API calls that enable real-time integrations. Well-documented APIs with SDKs accelerate development and enable powerful automation."`|-|
|Attribute|`"Product characteristics like size, color, material, or weight that help customers filter and find products. Attributes power faceted search and navigation, allowing shoppers to narrow down large catalogs efficiently. They also define product variants (e.g., a t-shirt in 3 colors and 5 sizes = 15 variants). Rich attributes improve SEO through structured data and enhance product feeds for Google Shopping. Consistent attribute naming and values are essential for filtering accuracy and data quality."`|-|
|Authorization|`"The process of verifying a payment method has sufficient funds and is valid before completing a transaction. During checkout, an authorization hold is placed on the customer's card for the order amount. The actual charge (capture) happens when the order ships. Authorizations typically expire after 7-30 days. Separate authorization and capture is useful for pre-orders, backordered items, or when final amounts may differ. Payment processors charge fees even for authorizations that are later voided."`|-|
|AI Personalization|`"Using artificial intelligence and machine learning to customize shopping experiences, recommendations, and content for individual users in real-time. AI analyzes browsing behavior, purchase history, demographic data, and contextual signals to predict preferences. Applications include product recommendations, personalized search results, dynamic content, email personalization, and chatbots. Leading platforms use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning models. AI personalization can increase conversion rates by 10-30% and average order value by 20-50%."`|-|
|Augmented Reality (AR)|`"Technology allowing customers to visualize products in their environment or on themselves through smartphone cameras before purchase. AR reduces return rates and increases conversion by giving shoppers confidence in their choices. Examples include furniture apps showing how a sofa looks in your living room, eyewear try-ons, and cosmetics virtual makeup testers. Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore power most mobile AR experiences. WebAR enables browser-based AR without app downloads."`|-|
|Abandoned Cart Recovery|`"Automated strategies and workflows to re-engage shoppers who added items to cart but didn't complete purchase. The most effective tactic is a series of 3-4 emails sent over 24-72 hours reminding customers about their cart, sometimes offering incentives. Timing matters: the first email should go within 1 hour while intent is fresh. Other recovery methods include SMS, push notifications, retargeting ads, and on-site popups for returning visitors. Recovery rates of 5-15% are typical for email sequences."`|-|
|Anchor Text|`"The clickable text in a hyperlink that describes the linked page's content. In ecommerce SEO, descriptive anchor text helps search engines understand page relationships and context. Internal links with keyword-rich anchors improve site structure and pass link equity. For product pages, anchors like 'blue running shoes' are more valuable than 'click here'. Over-optimization with exact-match anchors can trigger spam penalties, so natural variation is important."`|-|
|Analytics|`"The systematic collection, measurement, and analysis of website and business data to inform decisions. Ecommerce analytics spans web analytics (traffic, behavior), marketing analytics (campaign performance, attribution), sales analytics (revenue, conversion), and operational analytics (inventory, fulfillment). Key tools include Google Analytics 4, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and platform-native dashboards. Data-driven decisions require defining KPIs, implementing proper tracking, building dashboards, and cultivating analytical skills."`|-|
|Auto-Reorder|`"A subscription feature that automatically reorders consumable products on a schedule set by the customer. Popular for items with predictable usage patterns like supplements, pet food, cleaning supplies, and personal care. Auto-reorder increases customer lifetime value through recurring revenue and reduces churn by creating convenience. Flexible scheduling, easy cancellation, and discount incentives drive adoption. Also known as subscribe-and-save or replenishment programs."`|-|
