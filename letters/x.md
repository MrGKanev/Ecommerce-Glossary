|XML Sitemap|`"A file listing all website pages for search engines to crawl, helping ensure complete and efficient indexing. XML sitemaps include page URLs, last modification dates, change frequency, and priority hints. Sitemaps are typically located at /sitemap.xml and referenced in robots.txt. Large sites may use sitemap indexes linking to multiple sitemaps. Ecommerce sitemaps should include product pages, category pages, and content pages. Dynamic generation ensures new products are included automatically. Submitting sitemaps through Google Search Console speeds indexing. Image and video sitemaps help index rich media content. Sitemaps are essential for technical SEO."`|-|
|XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)|`"A security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing data or hijacking sessions. XSS attacks exploit inadequate input sanitization to insert executable code. Types include stored XSS (saved in database), reflected XSS (in URLs), and DOM-based XSS. Prevention requires proper input validation, output encoding, and Content Security Policy headers. For ecommerce, XSS risks include customer data theft, payment fraud, and admin account compromise. Regular security audits and penetration testing identify vulnerabilities. Modern frameworks include XSS protections, but custom code requires careful handling."`|-|
|X (formerly Twitter)|`"Social media platform used for brand engagement, customer service, real-time marketing, and social commerce. X enables direct customer communication, trend monitoring, and rapid response to events. Ecommerce uses include product announcements, customer support, influencer engagement, and community building. The platform's real-time nature suits timely promotions and trending topics. X advertising options include promoted tweets and products. The platform's evolution under new ownership has affected user behavior and brand strategies. Integration with ecommerce varies, with some brands finding strong engagement while others focus on alternative platforms."`|[Link](https://x.com)|
|XML|`"Extensible Markup Language - a structured data format used for product feeds, data exchange, and configurations. XML uses tags to define data elements in human-readable and machine-readable format. Common ecommerce XML uses include Google Merchant Center feeds, data imports/exports, and legacy system integrations. XML differs from JSON in verbosity but offers schema validation and attribute support. Many platforms accept both XML and CSV for data imports. Understanding XML structure helps with feed management, API integrations, and troubleshooting. Tools include XML validators, editors, and transformation utilities."`|-|
