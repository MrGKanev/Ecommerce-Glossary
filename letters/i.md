|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Inventory|`"The quantity and types of products a retailer has available for sale, requiring careful management to balance availability against carrying costs. Inventory management involves tracking stock levels, setting reorder points, managing safety stock, and conducting regular counts. Too much inventory ties up capital and risks obsolescence; too little causes stockouts and lost sales. Modern inventory systems provide real-time visibility across warehouses and channels. Inventory metrics include turnover ratio, days of inventory, and sell-through rate. Accurate inventory is essential for customer experience and profitability."`|-|
|Inbound Link|`"Links from external websites pointing to your site, valuable for SEO and driving referral traffic. Also called backlinks, they signal authority and trust to search engines. Quality matters more than quantity - links from relevant, authoritative sites are most valuable. Link building strategies include creating linkable content, guest posting, PR outreach, and resource page placements. Toxic links from spammy sites can harm rankings. Google's algorithm heavily weights inbound links for determining search rankings. Monitoring your backlink profile with tools like Ahrefs or Moz is essential for SEO."`|-|
|Inbound Marketing|`"Attracting customers through valuable content, SEO, and social media rather than interruptive paid ads. The methodology involves attracting visitors, converting them to leads, closing sales, and delighting customers into promoters. Content types include blog posts, videos, ebooks, webinars, and tools. Inbound marketing builds long-term assets that generate traffic without ongoing ad spend. Success requires understanding buyer personas, creating relevant content for each journey stage, and optimizing for search. Metrics include organic traffic, lead generation, and customer acquisition cost from inbound channels."`|-|
|Influencer Marketing|`"Partnering with social media personalities to promote products to their engaged followers, leveraging their credibility and reach. Influencer tiers range from nano (1K-10K followers) to mega (1M+), with engagement rates often inversely related to size. Compensation models include flat fees, affiliate commissions, and product gifting. Platforms include Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and blogs. Effective influencer marketing requires authentic fit between influencer and brand, clear deliverables, and proper disclosure (FTC compliance). Measuring ROI involves tracking codes, dedicated URLs, and attribution modeling."`|-|
|Instagram Shopping|`"Feature allowing businesses to tag and sell products directly within Instagram posts, stories, and Reels. Users can tap product tags to view details and purchase without leaving the app. Setup requires a Facebook shop, connected catalog, and business account approval. Instagram Shopping supports checkout within the app or redirect to your website. Product tagging in organic content provides free exposure. Shoppable ads amplify reach. Success requires high-quality visuals, strategic tagging, and engaging content. Instagram is a leading social commerce platform, especially for visual product categories."`|-|
|Integration|`"Connecting different software systems to share data and automate workflows, essential for efficient ecommerce operations. Common integrations link ecommerce platforms with ERP, accounting, shipping carriers, marketing tools, CRM, and inventory systems. Integration methods include native connectors, middleware platforms (Zapier, Celigo), and custom API development. Benefits include real-time data sync, reduced manual entry, fewer errors, and operational efficiency. Integration strategy should prioritize high-impact connections and consider total cost of ownership. Well-integrated systems enable scalable growth."`|-|
|Infinite Scroll|`"Loading more products as users scroll down, replacing traditional pagination with seamless continuous browsing. Advantages include reduced clicks and fluid exploration. Drawbacks include difficulty returning to specific positions, footer inaccessibility, and potential overwhelm. Hybrid approaches use 'Load More' buttons or combine infinite scroll with pagination controls. SEO requires proper implementation for crawlability. Mobile users often prefer infinite scroll while desktop users may prefer pagination. A/B testing reveals which approach drives better engagement for your audience."`|-|
|Invoice|`"Document detailing products purchased, prices, quantities, taxes, discounts, and payment terms, essential for B2B transactions and accounting. Invoices differ from receipts by requesting payment rather than confirming it. Invoice content includes seller/buyer details, invoice number, date, line items, totals, and payment instructions. Automated invoicing integrates with order management and accounting systems. B2B often requires purchase order matching and net payment terms (Net 30, Net 60). Proper invoicing supports cash flow management, tax compliance, and dispute resolution."`|-|
|Impression|`"A single instance of an ad, product, or content being displayed to a user, the foundational metric for measuring reach. Impressions count displays regardless of whether users notice or engage. CPM (cost per thousand impressions) is a common advertising pricing model. Impression share in PPC shows percentage of available impressions captured. For SEO, impressions in Search Console indicate visibility in search results. Impressions combined with clicks yield click-through rate (CTR). Viewability standards distinguish served impressions from actually-viewed impressions."`|-|
|Indexing|`"The process of search engines adding web pages to their database for potential display in search results. Indexing requires crawling (discovering pages) and processing content. Factors affecting indexing include site structure, XML sitemaps, robots.txt, crawl budget, and page quality. Google Search Console shows indexing status and issues. Pages must be indexed to appear in organic search. Noindex tags prevent indexing of thin content or duplicate pages. Internal linking helps search engines discover and index important pages. Fast indexing of new products requires proper technical SEO."`|-|
