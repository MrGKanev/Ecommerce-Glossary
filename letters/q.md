|QR Code|`"Quick Response code - a two-dimensional barcode that can store URLs, payment information, or product data, scannable with any smartphone camera. In ecommerce, QR codes bridge offline and online experiences: product packaging links to instructions, physical ads drive to landing pages, and payment QR codes enable contactless checkout. QR codes support tracking for campaign attribution. Dynamic QR codes allow destination changes without reprinting. Design considerations include size, contrast, and error correction levels. QR code adoption has surged post-pandemic, becoming standard for menus, payments, and marketing."`|-|
|Quality Assurance (QA)|`"The systematic process of testing websites, apps, checkout flows, and integrations to ensure they function correctly before launch and after updates. QA encompasses functional testing (features work as expected), usability testing (user experience), performance testing (speed, load handling), security testing, and regression testing (existing features still work after changes). Common ecommerce QA includes checkout flows, payment processing, mobile responsiveness, and edge cases. Automated testing tools speed up repetitive checks. QA prevents costly bugs that cause lost sales, damaged reputation, and customer frustration."`|-|
|Quick View|`"A feature allowing customers to preview product details in a modal popup without leaving the current page, reducing friction in the browsing experience. Quick view typically shows key information: image gallery, price, variants, add-to-cart button, and brief description. Benefits include faster comparison shopping and reduced page loads. Implementation should ensure all purchase-relevant info is visible and mobile-friendly. Quick view can increase add-to-cart rates by streamlining the path to purchase. Some users prefer full product pages for detailed information, so both options should be accessible."`|-|
|Quantity Discount|`"Price reductions offered when customers purchase larger quantities, incentivizing bulk orders and higher average order values. Also called volume discounts or tiered pricing. Examples: Buy 2 get 10% off, buy 5 get 25% off. Quantity discounts work well for consumables, B2B sales, and products with repeat purchase patterns. Display should clearly show savings at each tier. Implementation requires cart logic to apply correct discounts automatically. Quantity discounts can increase revenue per order while offering customers perceived value. They're also effective for moving inventory of slow sellers."`|-|
|Queue Management|`"Systems that manage high-traffic situations during major sales, product launches, or flash sales by placing customers in a virtual waiting room to prevent site crashes. Queue solutions like Queue-it and Cloudflare Waiting Room distribute traffic over time, ensure fairness, and maintain site stability. Customers see estimated wait times and position in queue. Without queue management, traffic spikes can crash sites, causing worse customer experience than organized waiting. Queue systems are essential for limited-edition drops, concert tickets, and Black Friday-scale events. Proper load testing helps determine when queues are needed."`|-|
|Quote Request|`"A B2B functionality allowing customers to request pricing for custom orders, bulk quantities, or configured products before purchase. Quote workflows involve customer submission, sales team review, custom pricing, and quote delivery. Requested information typically includes quantity, specifications, delivery requirements, and timeline. Integration with CRM and pricing systems streamlines the quote process. Quote-to-order conversion tracking measures sales effectiveness. For complex B2B products, quote-based selling is often necessary due to variable pricing, customization, and negotiation. Quote systems should capture enough information for accurate, fast responses."`|-|
