|Third-Party Logistics (3PL)|`"Outsourced logistics providers handling warehousing, order fulfillment, shipping, and returns for ecommerce businesses. 3PLs offer expertise, infrastructure, and scale that would be expensive to build in-house. Services include inventory storage, pick-and-pack, shipping label generation, and returns processing. Major 3PLs include ShipBob, Deliverr, and Flexport. 3PL selection criteria include location coverage, technology integration, pricing, and specialization. Benefits include scalability and geographic expansion; tradeoffs include less control and dependency. 3PLs enable growing businesses to focus on product and marketing while outsourcing operations."`|-|
|TikTok Shop|`"Ecommerce integration within TikTok allowing creators and brands to sell products directly through the platform's short-form video content. TikTok Shop combines content entertainment with seamless purchasing. Features include live shopping, shoppable videos, product showcases, and affiliate programs for creators. Setup requires business account, catalog integration, and compliance with platform policies. TikTok's algorithm drives product discovery to interested audiences. Success requires authentic, platform-native content rather than polished ads. TikTok Shop has grown rapidly, particularly for beauty, fashion, and trending products, especially among Gen Z consumers."`|[TikTok Shop](https://shop.tiktok.com)|
|Transaction Fee|`"A percentage and/or fixed amount charged by payment processors for each sale processed through their system. Typical fees range from 2.5-3.5% plus $0.25-0.30 per transaction. Fees vary by card type (credit vs debit, rewards vs basic), payment method (wallet, BNPL), and business risk level. High-volume merchants can negotiate better rates. Transaction fees significantly impact margins, especially for low-priced items. Fee structures include flat-rate (simple), interchange-plus (transparent), and tiered (complex). Understanding true processing costs helps optimize payment strategy and pricing."`|-|
|Tracking Number|`"Unique identifier provided for shipped orders allowing customers and merchants to monitor delivery progress in real-time. Tracking numbers are assigned by shipping carriers (UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL) and follow carrier-specific formats. Tracking integration in order status pages and email notifications improves customer experience and reduces 'Where is my order?' inquiries. Branded tracking pages extend the customer experience. Tracking data reveals delivery performance patterns. For international shipments, tracking visibility varies by destination. Proactive tracking notifications alert customers to delivery status, building trust and anticipation."`|-|
|Traffic|`"The number of visitors to your website, measured in sessions (visits) or unique visitors (people). Traffic sources include organic search, paid ads, social media, email, direct, and referral. Traffic quality matters as much as quantity - engaged visitors from relevant sources convert better. Traffic analysis reveals which channels and campaigns drive results. Traffic fluctuations may indicate SEO issues, seasonality, or market changes. Increasing traffic is one growth lever alongside conversion rate and average order value. The traffic x conversion rate x AOV formula shows how improvements compound."`|-|
|Trust Badge|`"Visual indicators displayed on websites, especially at checkout, that build customer confidence and reduce purchase anxiety. Trust badges include security seals (Norton, McAfee), payment logos (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal), guarantee badges (money-back, satisfaction), and certification marks (BBB, TrustPilot). Placement near CTAs and checkout forms maximizes impact. While badges help, actual security and service matter more. Overloading with badges can appear desperate. Testing which badges resonate with your audience is worthwhile. Trust is built through consistent experience, clear policies, and social proof alongside visual trust signals."`|-|
|Tax Compliance|`"Properly collecting, reporting, and remitting sales tax according to various jurisdictions where you sell, increasingly complex due to economic nexus laws. Since the 2018 Wayfair decision, US states can require tax collection based on sales volume into their state, regardless of physical presence. Each jurisdiction has different rates, rules, and filing requirements. Tax automation software like Avalara, TaxJar, and Vertex calculate correct taxes, file returns, and maintain compliance. International selling adds VAT, GST, and customs duties. Tax errors risk audits, penalties, and back-payments. Tax compliance is a necessary operational complexity for ecommerce."`|-|
|Theme|`"Pre-designed templates that determine the visual appearance, layout, and basic functionality of an ecommerce storefront. Themes include homepage design, product page layouts, navigation, and styling. Free themes provide basic functionality; premium themes ($100-400) offer advanced features and support. Theme selection affects brand perception, performance, and mobile experience. Customization ranges from simple color/font changes to extensive code modifications. Theme developers include Out of the Sandbox, Pixel Union, and theme stores within platforms. Headless commerce separates frontend design from commerce functionality, enabling fully custom experiences beyond theme constraints."`|-|
|Tokenization|`"Security process that replaces sensitive payment data with non-sensitive equivalent tokens, protecting customer information during storage and transmission. When a customer saves their card, the actual number is replaced with a random token. The original data is stored securely by the payment processor. Tokenization enables features like one-click checkout and recurring billing without storing actual card numbers. This reduces PCI compliance scope and breach risk. Payment providers like Stripe and Braintree handle tokenization automatically. Tokenization differs from encryption in that tokens have no mathematical relationship to original data and cannot be reversed."`|-|
|Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)|`"Security measure requiring two forms of verification to access accounts, protecting against unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Common 2FA factors include SMS codes, authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy), and hardware keys. Ecommerce applications include admin panel access, customer account security, and payment verification. 2FA significantly reduces account takeover fraud. Implementation should balance security with user friction. Offering but not requiring 2FA for customers is common; requiring it for admin access is best practice. 2FA is part of broader security posture including strong passwords and monitoring."`|-|
|Time on Site|`"Analytics metric measuring the average duration visitors spend on your website during a session, indicating engagement and content interest. Longer time on site generally suggests valuable content and engaged visitors, though it can also indicate difficulty finding information. For ecommerce, balancing browsing time with efficient path-to-purchase matters. Time on site by page type reveals which content engages visitors. Improving time on site involves compelling content, clear navigation, and relevant recommendations. Combined with bounce rate and pages per session, time on site provides engagement insights for optimization."`|-|
