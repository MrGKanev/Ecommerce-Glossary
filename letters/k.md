|Klarna|`"A leading Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service that allows customers to split purchases into interest-free installments or pay later, increasing conversion rates for merchants. Klarna offers multiple payment options: Pay in 4 installments, Pay in 30 days, and longer-term financing. Merchants receive full payment upfront minus fees (typically 2-6%). Klarna handles credit decisions, fraud risk, and collections. Integration is available for major ecommerce platforms. Klarna also provides a shopping app and browser extension driving traffic to partner merchants. Competitor alternatives include Affirm, Afterpay, and Shop Pay Installments."`|[Klarna](https://www.klarna.com)|
|KPI (Key Performance Indicator)|`"Measurable values that demonstrate how effectively an ecommerce business is achieving key objectives, essential for data-driven decision making. Core ecommerce KPIs include conversion rate, average order value (AOV), customer lifetime value (CLV), customer acquisition cost (CAC), cart abandonment rate, and revenue growth. Marketing KPIs include ROAS, CTR, and email open rates. Operations KPIs include order accuracy, ship time, and return rate. Effective KPI frameworks follow SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). Dashboards should track 5-10 KPIs aligned with strategic priorities."`|-|
|Keyword Research|`"The process of identifying search terms potential customers use to find products, essential for SEO and paid advertising strategies. Keyword research reveals search volume, competition, and user intent. Tools include Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Moz. For ecommerce, focus on product keywords, category terms, long-tail variations, and purchase-intent modifiers (buy, best, cheap). Keyword mapping assigns target terms to specific pages. Understanding keyword cannibalization prevents internal competition. Seasonal and trending keywords capture timely demand. Keyword research informs content strategy, site structure, and PPC campaigns."`|-|
|Kitting|`"The process of bundling multiple individual products together as a single SKU for sale, commonly used for gift sets, starter kits, or product bundles. Kitting differs from bundling at checkout - kitted products are pre-assembled with a unique SKU. Benefits include simplified inventory for popular combinations, cross-selling opportunities, and perceived value creation. Warehouse operations pick and pack kits as single units. Inventory systems must track both kit and component stock levels. Kitting requires clear naming, packaging specifications, and cost calculations for accurate margins."`|-|
|Knowledge Base|`"A self-service repository of information, FAQs, guides, and tutorials that helps customers find answers without contacting support. Knowledge bases reduce support ticket volume, improve customer satisfaction, and provide 24/7 assistance. Content types include how-to articles, troubleshooting guides, policy explanations, and video tutorials. Organization through categories, tags, and search functionality enables easy navigation. Analytics reveal popular searches and content gaps. Integration with chatbots enables automated answers. Well-maintained knowledge bases are continuously updated based on customer feedback and common support issues. Popular platforms include Zendesk, Helpscout, and Intercom."`|-|
|Kubernetes|`"An open-source container orchestration platform that automatically deploys, scales, and manages containerized applications, used by large ecommerce operations. Kubernetes (K8s) handles traffic spikes by auto-scaling resources, ensures high availability through redundancy, and enables consistent deployments across environments. Benefits include infrastructure portability, efficient resource utilization, and rapid scaling. The learning curve is significant, making it most appropriate for enterprises with DevOps capabilities. Managed Kubernetes services (AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS) reduce operational complexity. Kubernetes enables modern microservices architectures and supports headless commerce deployments."`|[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)|
|Key Value Proposition|`"The primary reason customers should choose your products or store over competitors, communicated clearly throughout the shopping experience. Strong value propositions address customer pain points, highlight unique benefits, and differentiate from alternatives. Elements include product quality, price, convenience, selection, expertise, or customer service. Value propositions should be specific and provable, not generic claims. Testing different messaging reveals what resonates with target audiences. The value proposition should be immediately clear on homepage and landing pages. Consistent reinforcement builds brand positioning."`|-|
