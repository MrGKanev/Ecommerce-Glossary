|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Call-To-Action (CTA)|`"Compelling text or buttons prompting visitors to take action, like 'Buy Now', 'Add to Cart', or 'Subscribe'. Effective CTAs are visually prominent, use action-oriented language, create urgency, and clearly communicate value. Button color, size, placement, and surrounding whitespace impact click rates. A/B testing different CTA variations is essential for optimization. Primary CTAs should be singular and focused, while secondary CTAs offer alternatives. Mobile CTAs require thumb-friendly placement and adequate tap targets."`|-|
|Cart Abandonment|`"When shoppers add items to cart but leave without purchasing, typically affecting 70% of carts industry-wide. Major causes include unexpected costs (shipping, taxes), required account creation, complex checkout, security concerns, and browsing without purchase intent. Reducing abandonment requires transparent pricing, guest checkout, multiple payment options, trust signals, and mobile optimization. Recovery strategies include abandoned cart emails, retargeting ads, exit-intent popups, and persistent carts that save items across sessions and devices."`|-|
|Conversion Rate|`"Percentage of visitors who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase, calculated as conversions divided by visitors times 100. Ecommerce conversion rates typically range from 1-4% depending on industry, traffic source, and product type. Higher-priced products generally have lower conversion rates. Improving conversion requires optimizing every step of the customer journey from landing page to checkout. Key factors include site speed, product presentation, pricing, trust signals, and checkout experience."`|-|
|Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)|`"Systematic process of improving website elements to increase the percentage of visitors who convert. CRO combines data analysis, user research, hypothesis creation, A/B testing, and iterative improvement. Common optimization areas include landing pages, product pages, cart, checkout, and forms. Effective CRO is data-driven, focusing on high-impact pages with significant traffic. Tools include heatmaps, session recordings, A/B testing platforms, and user surveys. CRO is more cost-effective than increasing traffic for growing revenue."`|-|
|Content Management System (CMS)|`"Software for creating and managing digital content without coding knowledge, powering product pages, blog posts, landing pages, and other content. Ecommerce platforms include built-in CMS features, while headless commerce separates CMS from commerce engine. Popular standalone CMS options include WordPress, Contentful, and Sanity. Key features include WYSIWYG editing, media management, version control, workflow approvals, and multi-language support. Headless CMS enables omnichannel content delivery across web, mobile, and in-store displays."`|-|
|Cache|`"Stored data that speeds up page loading by reducing server requests and database queries. Browser caching stores static files locally, CDN caching distributes content globally, and server-side caching stores computed results. Proper cache configuration dramatically improves site speed, which impacts conversion rates and SEO. Cache invalidation strategies ensure customers see updated content like prices and inventory. Common caching tools include Varnish, Redis, and CDN services like Cloudflare or Fastly."`|-|
|Chargeback|`"Forced transaction reversal initiated by the cardholder's bank, often due to disputes, fraud, or unrecognized charges. Chargebacks cost merchants the transaction amount plus fees ($20-100) and can result in account termination if rates exceed thresholds (typically 1%). Preventing chargebacks requires clear product descriptions, accurate fulfillment, good customer service, recognizable billing descriptors, and fraud prevention. When disputes occur, merchants can submit evidence to fight illegitimate chargebacks through the representment process."`|-|
|Churn Rate|`"Percentage of customers who stop buying or cancel subscriptions within a given period, critical for subscription and repeat-purchase businesses. Calculated as lost customers divided by starting customers. High churn signals product, service, or value issues. Reducing churn involves improving onboarding, engagement, customer success, loyalty programs, and win-back campaigns. Analyzing churn by cohort, plan type, and tenure reveals patterns. Even small churn reductions significantly impact customer lifetime value and revenue."`|-|
|CSV (Comma Separated Values)|`"File format for importing/exporting product data, orders, customer lists, and other tabular data. CSV files contain rows of data with values separated by commas (or other delimiters). Most ecommerce platforms support CSV import/export for bulk operations like uploading product catalogs, updating prices, or migrating data. Proper CSV formatting requires consistent columns, escaped special characters, and UTF-8 encoding for international characters. Excel or Google Sheets can create and edit CSV files."`|-|
|Cookies|`"Small data files stored in browsers to remember user preferences, cart contents, login sessions, and tracking data. First-party cookies set by the website enable essential functions like shopping carts and personalization. Third-party cookies from external services power advertising and analytics but are being phased out due to privacy concerns. GDPR and similar regulations require cookie consent for non-essential cookies. The shift away from third-party cookies is driving adoption of first-party data strategies."`|-|
|Composable Commerce|`"Modern architecture using best-of-breed, API-first components instead of monolithic platforms. Composable commerce allows merchants to select specialized solutions for each capability (CMS, search, PIM, checkout) and integrate them via APIs. This approach offers flexibility, scalability, and the ability to swap components without rebuilding the entire stack. MACH architecture (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless) is a related concept. Composable commerce suits complex enterprises but requires technical expertise to implement and maintain."`|-|
|Customer Data Platform (CDP)|`"Software unifying customer data from all touchpoints into a single customer profile for personalization and marketing. CDPs ingest data from websites, apps, email, POS, customer service, and advertising platforms, resolving identity across devices and channels. Use cases include real-time personalization, audience segmentation, triggered campaigns, and analytics. Unlike DMPs focused on anonymous audiences, CDPs build persistent first-party profiles. Popular CDPs include Segment, mParticle, and Bloomreach."`|-|
|Click-Through Rate (CTR)|`"Percentage of people who click on a link or ad after seeing it, calculated as clicks divided by impressions. CTR measures the effectiveness of ads, emails, search results, and CTAs. Benchmarks vary widely: search ads (2-5%), display ads (0.1-0.5%), email (2-5%). Low CTR suggests weak creative, poor targeting, or irrelevant messaging. Improving CTR involves testing headlines, images, ad copy, and targeting. High CTR with low conversion may indicate clickbait or landing page problems."`|-|
|Cross-Selling|`"Recommending complementary products to increase order value, such as suggesting a case when buying a phone. Cross-selling differs from upselling, which promotes higher-end versions of the same product. Effective cross-sells are genuinely useful, appropriately priced relative to the main product, and displayed at the right moment (product page, cart, post-purchase). AI-powered recommendations improve relevance by analyzing purchase patterns. 'Frequently bought together' and 'Customers also bought' are common cross-sell formats."`|-|
|Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)|`"The total cost of acquiring a new customer, including marketing, advertising, and sales expenses. Calculated as total acquisition costs divided by new customers acquired. CAC must be lower than customer lifetime value (LTV) for sustainable business. The LTV:CAC ratio should be at least 3:1 for healthy unit economics. Reducing CAC involves improving conversion rates, optimizing ad spend, and leveraging organic channels like SEO, referrals, and word of mouth."`|-|
|Customer Lifetime Value (CLV/LTV)|`"The predicted total revenue from a single customer throughout their relationship with your brand. LTV calculation methods range from simple (average order value x purchase frequency x customer lifespan) to complex predictive models. LTV informs how much to invest in acquisition, retention, and customer experience. Strategies to increase LTV include improving retention, increasing purchase frequency, raising average order value, and reducing churn. Segmenting customers by LTV enables differentiated treatment and resource allocation."`|-|
|Customer Segmentation|`"Dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics for targeted marketing and personalization. Segmentation criteria include demographics (age, location, gender), behavior (purchase history, browsing patterns), psychographics (values, interests), and RFM analysis (recency, frequency, monetary value). Effective segmentation enables personalized email campaigns, dynamic website content, and targeted advertising. Advanced segmentation uses machine learning for predictive clustering. Each segment should be actionable with distinct strategies."`|-|
|Checkout Flow|`"The sequence of steps a customer completes to finalize a purchase, from cart to order confirmation. Optimal checkout flows minimize friction through progress indicators, guest checkout option, auto-fill capabilities, multiple payment methods, and mobile optimization. Single-page checkout reduces steps but may feel overwhelming. Multi-step checkout breaks the process into digestible chunks. Common checkout fields include shipping address, shipping method, billing address, payment details, and order review. Every additional step typically reduces completion rates."`|-|
