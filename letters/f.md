|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Fulfillment|`"The process of receiving, processing, picking, packing, and shipping customer orders from warehouse to doorstep. Fulfillment encompasses inventory storage, order management, quality control, and shipping label generation. Options include in-house fulfillment, third-party logistics (3PL), dropshipping, and Amazon FBA. Efficient fulfillment reduces shipping costs, speeds delivery, and improves customer satisfaction. Key metrics include order accuracy rate, ship time, and cost per order. Fulfillment strategy significantly impacts profitability and customer experience."`|-|
|Fulfillment Center|`"Warehouse facilities that store inventory and process orders for ecommerce businesses, operated by 3PL providers or in-house teams. Fulfillment centers differ from traditional warehouses by focusing on picking, packing, and shipping individual orders rather than bulk storage and distribution. Features include barcode systems, conveyor belts, packing stations, and shipping integrations. Location strategy involves balancing proximity to customers (faster delivery) with operational costs. Multi-location fulfillment reduces shipping distances and enables 2-day delivery coverage."`|-|
|Free Shipping|`"Delivery without cost to the customer, one of the most powerful conversion incentives in ecommerce. Unexpected shipping costs are the #1 cause of cart abandonment. Free shipping can be unconditional or threshold-based (free above $50). Merchants absorb costs through pricing strategy, minimum order requirements, or slower shipping methods. Displaying free shipping thresholds prominently and showing progress (You're $15 away from free shipping!) increases average order value. Free shipping has become a customer expectation, especially competing with Amazon Prime."`|-|
|Fraud Detection|`"Systems and algorithms that identify suspicious transactions to prevent chargebacks and financial losses. Fraud signals include mismatched billing/shipping addresses, high-risk locations, unusual order patterns, multiple failed payment attempts, and velocity checks. Modern fraud detection uses machine learning to balance fraud prevention with minimizing false declines of legitimate orders. Tools include Signifyd, Riskified, and built-in platform features. Multi-layered approaches combine rules, machine learning, and manual review. Fraud costs include direct losses, chargebacks, and operational overhead."`|-|
|Funnel|`"The customer journey stages from awareness to purchase, visualizing where visitors drop off at each step. Typical ecommerce funnel stages: Visit > Product View > Add to Cart > Checkout Start > Purchase. Funnel analysis identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. Conversion rate between stages helps prioritize improvements. A 2% overall conversion might hide a 50% cart-to-checkout drop that's fixable. Marketing funnels track stages from ad impression through sale. Customer journey mapping provides qualitative insights alongside funnel metrics."`|-|
|First-Party Data|`"Customer data collected directly by your business through owned channels like website, app, email, and purchases. First-party data is increasingly valuable as third-party cookies phase out and privacy regulations tighten. Examples include purchase history, browsing behavior, email engagement, and survey responses. First-party data enables personalization, customer segmentation, and lookalike audience creation. Building first-party data requires value exchange - customers share data in return for better experiences, discounts, or content. Data governance and security are essential."`|-|
|Flash Sale|`"Limited-time promotions creating urgency and driving quick purchase decisions, typically lasting hours to a few days. Flash sales feature steep discounts, countdown timers, and limited quantities. They're effective for clearing inventory, acquiring new customers, and generating buzz. Risks include training customers to wait for sales, margin erosion, and brand perception issues. Successful flash sales require email/SMS promotion, site preparation for traffic spikes, and inventory management. Flash sale sites like Groupon pioneered the model, but now most retailers use flash sales strategically."`|-|
|Faceted Search|`"Filter-based navigation allowing customers to narrow products by attributes like price, size, color, brand, rating, and more. Faceted search is essential for stores with large catalogs, helping customers find products efficiently. Dynamic facets show only relevant options based on current results. Best practices include showing result counts per option, allowing multiple selections, and remembering filter states. Mobile-optimized facets often use slide-out panels. Poor faceted search leads to frustration and abandonment. Implementation requires proper product attribute management."`|-|
|Featured Products|`"Products highlighted for special visibility on homepage, category pages, or promotional sections. Featuring can be manual curation or algorithm-driven based on popularity, margin, inventory levels, or personalization. Featured product sections include 'Best Sellers', 'New Arrivals', 'Staff Picks', and 'Trending Now'. Strategic featuring can boost sales of high-margin items, clear slow inventory, or introduce new products. A/B testing different featured products reveals what resonates with customers."`|-|
|Financing|`"Payment options allowing customers to spread purchases over time, making expensive items more accessible. Options include BNPL (Klarna, Affirm), store credit cards, and traditional financing through partners. Financing increases conversion for high-ticket items and raises average order value. Merchants typically receive full payment upfront while the financing provider handles installment collection. Integration appears at checkout with instant approval decisions. Transparent terms and responsible lending practices maintain customer trust."`|-|
|Forecast Accuracy|`"The degree to which demand predictions match actual sales, measured as percentage error. Accurate forecasts prevent stockouts and overstock situations. Metrics include MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and bias (over vs under-forecasting). Improving accuracy involves incorporating historical data, seasonality, promotions, market trends, and machine learning. Collaboration between planning, sales, and marketing improves forecast inputs. Weather, economic conditions, and unexpected events affect accuracy. Even modest accuracy improvements significantly impact inventory costs and service levels."`|-|
