|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Payment Gateway|`"A service that securely authorizes and processes credit card and digital payments between customers and merchants. Payment gateways encrypt sensitive data, communicate with card networks and banks, and return authorization decisions in real-time. Popular gateways include Stripe, PayPal, Square, and Authorize.net. Gateway selection affects supported payment methods, international currencies, fees (typically 2.5-3.5% plus fixed per-transaction), and integration complexity. Features like 3D Secure, fraud prevention, and recurring billing vary by provider. Seamless payment experiences are critical for conversion."`|-|
|PCI Compliance|`"Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) - mandatory requirements for any business handling credit card information. Compliance levels depend on transaction volume. Requirements include secure networks, encryption, access controls, vulnerability testing, and security policies. Non-compliance risks fines, higher processing fees, and breach liability. Using PCI-compliant payment providers (Stripe, PayPal) reduces merchant compliance burden by handling card data. Merchants must still complete Self-Assessment Questionnaires annually. Security breaches devastate customer trust and business reputation."`|[PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org)|
|Personalization|`"Tailoring the shopping experience to individual customers based on their behavior, preferences, demographics, and purchase history. Personalization applications include product recommendations, dynamic content, personalized emails, customized search results, and individualized pricing. AI and machine learning enable real-time personalization at scale. Benefits include increased conversion (10-30%), higher average order value, and improved customer loyalty. Personalization requires data collection, consent compliance, and continuous optimization. The spectrum ranges from simple (location-based currency) to sophisticated (predictive recommendations). Customers increasingly expect personalized experiences."`|-|
|Product Information Management (PIM)|`"Centralized software for managing all product data, descriptions, images, attributes, and digital assets across multiple sales channels. PIM ensures consistent, accurate product information everywhere products are sold. Features include data validation, workflow approvals, localization, and channel-specific formatting. Benefits include reduced errors, faster time-to-market, and improved data quality. PIM integrates with ecommerce platforms, marketplaces, and print catalogs. Essential for businesses with large catalogs, multiple channels, or international presence. Popular PIMs include Akeneo, Salsify, and inRiver."`|-|
|Print on Demand (POD)|`"A fulfillment model where products are only printed or created after a customer orders, eliminating inventory risk for custom items. Common POD products include apparel, books, posters, mugs, and phone cases. Providers like Printful, Printify, and Gooten handle production and shipping. Benefits include no upfront inventory investment, unlimited product variety, and easy testing. Tradeoffs include higher per-unit costs, longer shipping times, and limited quality control. POD enables creative entrepreneurs and niche products that wouldn't justify traditional manufacturing minimums."`|-|
|Progressive Web App (PWA)|`"Web applications that provide app-like experiences on mobile devices without requiring download from app stores. PWAs combine web accessibility with native app features: offline capability, push notifications, home screen installation, and fast performance. Benefits include single codebase for web and mobile, no app store approval process, and automatic updates. Ecommerce PWAs can significantly improve mobile conversion rates. Implementation requires service workers, manifest files, and HTTPS. Shopify, BigCommerce, and custom platforms support PWA development."`|-|
|Push Notification|`"Clickable pop-up messages sent to users' devices (mobile or desktop) for marketing, order updates, or re-engagement campaigns. Push notifications can reach users even when they're not on your site, enabling real-time communication. Use cases include abandoned cart reminders, price drops, back-in-stock alerts, and order tracking. Effectiveness depends on permission opt-in, relevance, and timing. Over-notification causes users to disable permissions. Rich push includes images and action buttons. Web push works on desktop browsers; mobile push requires app installation or PWA. Tools include OneSignal, PushOwl, and Braze."`|-|
|Product Feed|`"A file containing structured product data submitted to advertising platforms, marketplaces, and comparison shopping engines. Feeds include titles, descriptions, prices, images, availability, identifiers (GTIN/UPC), and custom attributes. Feed quality directly impacts ad performance and approval rates. Google Merchant Center, Facebook Catalog, and Pinterest require specific feed formats. Feed management tools automate updates, transformations, and multi-channel distribution. Common issues include missing data, policy violations, and sync delays. Well-optimized feeds improve visibility, click-through rates, and ROAS."`|-|
|Pricing Strategy|`"The methodology for setting product prices to achieve business objectives like profitability, market share, or positioning. Strategies include cost-plus (markup over costs), competitive (market-based), value-based (customer perception), and dynamic pricing (real-time adjustment). Psychological pricing uses techniques like charm pricing ($9.99) and anchoring. Bundle pricing incentivizes larger purchases. Premium pricing signals quality. Pricing affects margin, conversion, and brand perception. Testing prices reveals demand elasticity. Pricing strategy should align with overall positioning and customer expectations."`|-|
|Pre-Order|`"Allowing customers to purchase products before they are available, securing sales and gauging demand before production or inventory arrival. Pre-orders help fund product development, reduce inventory risk, and build excitement. Implementation requires clear communication about expected delivery dates and payment timing (charge now or later). Pre-order strategies include limited quantities for urgency, early-bird pricing, and exclusive variants. Managing customer expectations is critical - delays damage trust. Post-launch, converting pre-order campaigns to regular sales maintains momentum."`|-|
|Product Photography|`"Visual representation of products through images and videos, arguably the most important element of ecommerce product pages. Quality product photography includes hero images, multiple angles, zoom capability, lifestyle shots, size reference, and video. Consistent styling builds brand identity. Technical requirements include proper lighting, high resolution, and optimized file sizes for fast loading. Product photography directly impacts conversion rates and return rates. Investment in photography typically provides strong ROI. User-generated photos and 360-degree views enhance authenticity and understanding."`|-|
