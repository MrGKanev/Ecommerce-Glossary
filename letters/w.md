|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Wholesale|`"Selling products in bulk to retailers or other businesses at discounted prices for resale, representing a B2B revenue channel. Wholesale pricing typically offers 30-50% off retail to enable retailer margins. Wholesale operations require minimum orders, net payment terms, and different fulfillment processes. Multi-channel brands often sell both D2C (direct) and wholesale. Wholesale management includes order management, invoicing, and relationship maintenance. Digital wholesale platforms (NuORDER, Joor) modernize the buying process. Wholesale expands distribution but reduces margins and customer relationship control."`|-|
|WooCommerce|`"The most popular open-source ecommerce plugin for WordPress, powering millions of online stores worldwide. WooCommerce is free with revenue from extensions and WooCommerce Payments. Benefits include WordPress integration, unlimited customization, no transaction fees, and huge plugin ecosystem. Tradeoffs include hosting responsibility, security management, and need for technical maintenance. WooCommerce suits those comfortable with WordPress or wanting full control. Extensions add functionality for subscriptions, bookings, B2B, and more. The platform ranges from small blogs selling products to large, complex stores with proper development."`|[Link](https://woocommerce.com)|
|Web Analytics|`"Tools and methods for collecting, measuring, and analyzing website visitor behavior to inform decisions. Core metrics include visitors, sessions, pageviews, bounce rate, conversion rate, and revenue. Analytics tools include Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, and Mixpanel. Implementation requires proper tracking setup, enhanced ecommerce configuration, and event tracking. Analytics reveals traffic sources, user behavior, conversion funnels, and campaign performance. Data-driven decisions outperform intuition. Common analysis includes cohort analysis, attribution modeling, and A/B test evaluation. Privacy regulations affect tracking capabilities, driving focus toward first-party data."`|-|
|Wishlist|`"Feature allowing customers to save products for future purchase, indicating interest and enabling personalized marketing. Wishlists serve as shopping planning tools and gift registries. Marketing uses include wishlist reminder emails, price drop alerts, and back-in-stock notifications. Wishlist data reveals product interest for merchandising and demand planning. Social sharing of wishlists enables gift-giving. Persistent wishlists across devices require account creation or cookies. Wishlist conversion rate tracks eventual purchases. For high-consideration products, wishlists are part of the natural decision journey. Implementation should make adding and accessing wishlists frictionless."`|-|
|Webhook|`"Automated HTTP callbacks that send data between applications when specific events occur, enabling real-time integrations without polling. When an event happens (order placed, product updated, customer created), the webhook sends relevant data to a configured URL. Common ecommerce webhooks include order notifications to fulfillment systems, inventory updates to channels, and customer data to CRMs. Webhooks reduce latency compared to scheduled syncs. Implementation requires secure endpoints, signature verification, and retry handling for failures. Webhook management includes monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting. Webhooks are fundamental to modern ecommerce integrations."`|-|
|White Label|`"Products or services produced by one company that others rebrand and sell as their own. In ecommerce, white label includes private label products (manufacturer's goods under your brand), white label software (platforms you rebrand), and fulfillment services (3PL under your brand). White labeling enables faster market entry without product development. Tradeoffs include less differentiation and dependency on suppliers. White label products require brand building beyond the product itself. Quality control ensures your brand standards are maintained. White label is common in supplements, cosmetics, and electronics."`|-|
|Warehouse Management System (WMS)|`"Software for managing inventory, orders, and fulfillment operations in warehouses. WMS features include inventory tracking, pick path optimization, bin/location management, barcode scanning, wave picking, and labor management. WMS improves efficiency, accuracy, and visibility in fulfillment operations. Integration with ecommerce platforms and ERPs enables automated order flow. WMS selection depends on warehouse size, complexity, and volume. Options range from spreadsheets to enterprise systems like Manhattan Associates. 3PLs provide WMS as part of their services. Proper WMS implementation significantly improves operational metrics."`|-|
|Web Vitals|`"Google's metrics measuring page load speed, interactivity, and visual stability, important for SEO and user experience. Core Web Vitals include LCP (Largest Contentful Paint - loading), FID/INP (First Input Delay/Interaction to Next Paint - interactivity), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift - visual stability). Google uses these as ranking factors. Measurement tools include PageSpeed Insights, Chrome DevTools, and Search Console. Improving Web Vitals involves optimizing images, reducing JavaScript, leveraging caching, and stabilizing layouts. Mobile performance is particularly important. Web Vitals directly impact both SEO rankings and conversion rates."`|-|
|Win-Back Campaign|`"Marketing campaigns targeting lapsed customers who haven't purchased within a defined period, attempting to re-engage and reactivate them. Win-back triggers typically activate after 60-180 days of inactivity. Tactics include personalized emails, special discounts, product updates, and reminders of past purchases. Win-back success rates are typically 5-15%, still valuable given lower cost than new acquisition. Email sequences often include 2-4 messages before suppression. Understanding why customers lapsed (product issue, competition, life change) informs messaging. Win-back data also reveals which customers should be sunset from active marketing."`|-|
