|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Marketplace|`"An ecommerce platform where multiple third-party sellers can list and sell products, creating a one-stop shopping destination. Major marketplaces include Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and Walmart. Marketplaces offer built-in traffic, trust, and infrastructure in exchange for fees (typically 10-20%) and competition with other sellers. Sellers must follow marketplace rules and often lose direct customer relationships. Multi-marketplace selling diversifies revenue but requires inventory sync and management tools. Building your own marketplace requires significant investment in technology, seller acquisition, and buyer trust."`|-|
|Merchant of Record (MoR)|`"The entity legally responsible for processing customer payments and handling tax compliance, chargebacks, refunds, and financial regulations. The MoR appears on customer bank statements. For direct sales, merchants are typically their own MoR. Payment providers like Shopify Payments, Stripe, and Paddle can serve as MoR, handling sales tax collection, international VAT, and payment disputes. MoR services simplify global selling by managing complex tax jurisdictions. The tradeoff is higher fees in exchange for reduced compliance burden and liability."`|-|
|Meta Tags|`"HTML elements that provide metadata about a webpage to search engines and social platforms, crucial for SEO and social sharing. Key meta tags include title tag (clickable headline in search results), meta description (search snippet), robots directives, and Open Graph tags (social previews). Each product page should have unique, optimized meta tags. Title tags under 60 characters and descriptions under 160 characters display fully in search results. Meta tags don't directly affect rankings but influence click-through rates, which indirectly impact SEO."`|-|
|Microservices|`"An architectural approach where ecommerce applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate via APIs. Each microservice handles a specific function: cart, checkout, inventory, search, etc. Benefits include independent scaling, technology flexibility, and isolated failure handling. Microservices enable composable commerce where best-of-breed solutions combine for each capability. Challenges include operational complexity, distributed systems management, and integration overhead. Microservices suit large enterprises with sophisticated DevOps capabilities. Monolithic platforms remain appropriate for many businesses."`|-|
|Mobile Commerce (M-Commerce)|`"Buying and selling goods through mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), now accounting for over 70% of ecommerce traffic and growing. Mobile commerce requires responsive design, fast loading, thumb-friendly interfaces, and mobile payment options (Apple Pay, Google Pay). Key optimizations include simplified navigation, large touch targets, autofill forms, and accelerated checkout. Mobile conversion rates typically lag desktop due to smaller screens and distractions. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) bridge web and app experiences. Understanding mobile user behavior is essential for modern ecommerce success."`|-|
|Multi-Channel Selling|`"Selling products across multiple platforms and channels including your own website, Amazon, eBay, social media, and physical stores. Multi-channel expands reach and diversifies revenue but increases operational complexity. Challenges include inventory synchronization, consistent pricing, order management across platforms, and channel-specific optimization. Multi-channel management software centralizes operations. Channel strategies should consider fees, control, margins, and audience fit. The distinction from omnichannel is that multi-channel may operate in silos while omnichannel creates unified customer experiences."`|-|
|Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)|`"The smallest number of units a supplier will sell at once, a key consideration for inventory planning and supplier negotiations. MOQs exist because suppliers have production minimums and setup costs. Lower MOQs reduce inventory risk but may increase per-unit costs. Negotiating MOQs is possible, especially with established relationships or during slow periods. For new products, high MOQs increase risk if demand is uncertain. Dropshipping and print-on-demand eliminate MOQ concerns but have higher per-unit costs. MOQ impacts cash flow, storage needs, and product assortment decisions."`|-|
|Machine Learning|`"AI technology that enables systems to learn from data and improve without explicit programming, transforming ecommerce through personalization, automation, and prediction. Applications include product recommendations, search relevance, demand forecasting, dynamic pricing, fraud detection, customer segmentation, and chatbots. Machine learning models require quality data, ongoing training, and performance monitoring. Benefits include improved customer experience, operational efficiency, and competitive advantage. Implementation ranges from platform-native features to custom model development. Machine learning is increasingly essential for competitive ecommerce."`|-|
|Markdown|`"A lightweight text formatting syntax that converts to HTML, commonly used for product descriptions, blog posts, and documentation. Markdown uses simple symbols for formatting: *bold*, _italic_, ## headings, - bullets, and [links](url). Benefits include readability, portability, and simplicity compared to rich text editors. Many ecommerce platforms support Markdown for content creation. Understanding Markdown helps with content management, documentation, and developer communication. Popular Markdown editors include Notion, Typora, and VSCode."`|-|
|Metrics|`"Quantitative measurements used to track, evaluate, and improve business performance. Ecommerce metrics span sales (revenue, AOV, conversion), marketing (CAC, ROAS, CTR), operations (fulfillment time, return rate), and customer (LTV, NPS, retention). Effective metric frameworks distinguish leading indicators (predictive) from lagging indicators (historical). Dashboards visualize key metrics for quick understanding. Vanity metrics look good but don't indicate business health. Actionable metrics drive decision-making. Building a metrics culture requires accessible data, regular review cadences, and accountability."`|-|
